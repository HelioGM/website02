However, there are currently no commercially\ravailable rootstocks resistant to root-knot nematodes (RKN),\rMeloidogyne spp., infection in the Cucurbitacea family, and also a\rnarrow diversity in the Solanaceae, mostly in tomato and pepper. In\rorder find alternatives to address this problem, the main objective of\rthis thesis was to determine the durability of resistance to\rMeloidogyne of Citrullus amarus and Solanum torvum as potential\rrootstocks for watermelon and eggplant, respectively. In the first part\rof this document, the work conducted with the cucurbits is presented in\rchapters one and two, while chapters three and four correspond to work\rdone with solanaceous.\nDurabilty of Citrullus amarus resistance to Meloidogyne: the\rresponse of two Citrullus amarus accessions, BGV0005164 and\rBGV0005167, was assessed against different Meloidogyne arenaria, M.\rincognita, and M. javanica isolates in pot experiments and against\rM. incognita in plastic greenhouse. (i) In the pot experiments, plants\rwere inoculated with a second-stage juvenile per cm3 of sterile sand\rand maintained in a growth chamber at 25 C for 50 days. The watermelon\rcv. Sugar Baby was included as a susceptible control for comparison. At\rthe end of the experiments, the number of egg masses and eggs per plant\rwas determined, and the reproduction index was calculated as the\rpercentage of the number of eggs produced in the C. amarus accessions\rwith regard to that produced in the susceptible cv. Sugar Baby. (ii) In\rthe plastic greenhouse experiment, the ungrafted watermelon cv. Sugar\rBaby and watermelon grafted onto each of the C. amarus accessions and\ronto the watermelon rootstock cv. Robusta were cultivated from May to\rAugust 2016 in plots with nematode densities from 46 to 1392 J2 per 250\rcm3 of soil at transplantation. At the end of the experiment, the\rgalling index and the number of eggs per plant were determined, and the\rreproduction index was calculated. (iii) Additionally, the compatibility\rof the two accessions with the watermelon cv. Sugar Baby and the effect\ron fruit quality (weight, size, shape, firmness, pH, total soluble\rsolids, and flesh color) were assessed under a hydroponic system in a\rgreenhouse. The commercial rootstocks cv. Cobalt and cv. Robusta were\ralso included. Moreover (iv) The response of ungrafted and grafted\rwatermelon cv. Sugar baby onto the C. amarus accessions BGV0005164 and\rBGV0005167 submitted to increasing densities of M. incognita and M.\rjavanica was studied in pot experiments to determine the maximum\rmultiplication rate, the maximum population density and the equilibrium\rdensity of the root-knot nematode species and the effect on shoot dry\rbiomass of watermelon. (v) In plastic greenhouse conditions, the\rungrafted and grafted watermelon onto both C. amarus accessions, and\ronto the C. lanatus rootstock cv. Robusta were cultivated for two\rconsecutive years in the same plots to assess the level of resistance to\rM. incognita and crop yield. (vi) Additionally, after the second crop,\rthe putative selection for virulence in the nematode subpopulation\roriginated in the ungrafted and grafted watermelon was assessed in pot\rexperiments. The results showed that (i) all the Meloidogyne isolates\rproduced fewer egg masses and eggs per plant in the accessions than in\rSugar Baby. Both accessions performed as resistant against M.\rarenaria, and from highly to moderately resistant to M. incognita and\rM. javanica in pot experiments. (ii) In the plastic greenhouse\rexperiment, both C. amarus accessions performed as resistant to M.\rincognita. (iii) Both C. amarus accessions were compatible with the\rwatermelon cv. Sugar Baby, but only the BGV0005167 accession did not\rinfluence the fruit quality. (iv) The maximum multiplication rate, the\rmaximum population density and the equilibrium density values of both\rMeloidogyne species were lower in grafted than ungrafted watermelon.\r(v) In the plastic greenhouse experiment, the nematode densities in soil\rat transplantation ranged from 1 to 53 J2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil in\r2017 and did not differ between grafted and ungrafted watermelons. At\rthe end of the crop, the galling index and the number of eggs per plant\rwas higher in ungrafted than in grafted watermelon both years. The C.\ramarus accessions performed from highly resistant to resistant to M.\rincognita, and the rootstock cv. Robusta from moderately resistant in\r2017 to slightly resistant in 2018. All grafted watermelons yielded more\rkg per plant than the ungrafted in both years. (vi) The repeated\rcultivation of grafted watermelon onto C. amarus accessions did not\rselect for virulence. In conclusion, the BGV0005167 accession is a\rpromising rootstock for managing the three tropical root-knot nematode\rspecies without influencing watermelon fruit quality. The results of\rthis study highlight the poorer host status of CI64 and CI67 accessions\rto M. incognita and M. javanica compared to watermelon; the\rstability of the C. amarus resistance; and the beneficial effect of\rC. amarus on watermelon yield when cultivated in Meloidogyne\rinfested soils.\nDurabilty of Solanum torvum resistance to Meloidogyne: several\rexperiments were carried out to assess the performance of commercial\rSolanum torvum cultivars against Meloidogyne incognita and M.\rjavanica isolates from Spain. (i) The response of S. torvum rootstock\rcultivars Brutus, Espina, Salutamu and Torpedo against M. incognita\rand Mi1.2 (a)virulent M. javanica isolates was determined in pot\rexperiments, and of cv. Brutus to an N-virulent isolate of M.\rincognita, compared with that of the eggplant cv. Cristal. (ii) The\rrelationship between the initial and final population densities of M.\rjavanica on ungrafted and grafted ‘Cristal’ onto the S. torvum\r‘Brutus’ was assessed, together with the effect on dry shoot biomass.\r(iii) Finally, the population growth rate and the resistance level of\rthe four S. torvum cultivars against M. incognita was assessed under\rplastic greenhouse conditions in two cropping seasons. (iv) The eggplant\rSolanum melongena cv. Cristal, either ungrafted or grafted onto the\rS. torvum rootstock cv. Brutus was cultivated for two consecutive\ryears in the same plots in a plastic greenhouse to assess the level of\rresistance to M. incognita and crop yield. (v) At the end of the\rsecond crop, the putative selection for virulence of the nematode\rsubpopulations coming from infected ungrafted and grafted eggplant was\rassessed in the eggplant and in S. torvum in a pot experiment. The\rresults showed that: (i) all S. torvum rootstocks responded as\rresistant to the M. incognita isolates and from highly resistant to\rsusceptible against M. javanica isolates. (ii) The maximum\rmultiplication rate of M. javanica on the ungrafted or grafted\reggplant were 270 and 49, respectively, and the equilibrium density were\r1318 and 2056 eggs and J2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) soil, respectively. The\rtolerance of the ungrafted eggplant was 10.9 J2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) soil,\rand the minimum relative dry shoot biomass was 0.76. (iii) The\rpopulation growth rate of M. incognita on eggplant cv. Cristal\rdiffered from that of the S. torvum cultivars in both cropping\rseasons. (iv) Nematode population densities at transplantation in 2017\rranged from 2 to 378 J2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil and did not differ\rbetween ungrafted and grafted eggplant. At the end of each crop, higher\rgalling index and number of nematodes in soil and in roots were\rregistered in ungrafted than grafted eggplant. The grafted eggplant\rperformed as resistant in 2017 and as highly resistant in 2018. Eggplant\ryield did not differ irrespective of grafting in 2017 after being\rcultivated for 135 days, but it differed after 251 days of cultivation\rin 2018. (v) In the pot experiment, S. torvum performed as resistant\rto both M. incognita subpopulations. However, the M. incognita\rsubpopulation obtained from roots of S. torvum produced 49.4% less egg\rmasses and 56% less eggs per plant in the eggplant than the nematode\rsubpopulation obtained from roots of the eggplant cv. Cristal. These\rresults suggest that S. torvum is a valuable rootstock for managing\rthe two Meloidogyne species irrespective of the (a)virulence status,\rand revealed that the infective and reproductive fitness of the nematode\rdecrease without having been selected for virulence.\nGeneral introduction\rDurability of resistance to Meloidogyne spp. mediated by R-genes in\rsolanaceous and cucurbitaceous crops\nHelio A. García-Mendívil\nPhD Dissertation\nMeloidogyne spp.\rBiology\rRoot-knot nematodes (RKN), Meloidogyne spp., are the most damaging\rplant parasitic nematodes worldwide. This genus comprises more than 100\rspecies, however, most of the crop yield losses are caused by four of\rthem: the tropical species M. arenaria, M. incognita and M.\rjavanica, and the temperate species M. hapla (Jones et al. 2013). The\rwidened global warming can favor the expansion and proliferation of the\rRKN tropical species in areas where the temperate RKN species\rpredominates. This fact evidence the importance of focusing research\refforts for designing management strategies to the tropical RKN species.\nRKN are obligated parasites that require a suitable host plant for life\rcycle completion (Fig.\r1). The infective pre-parasitic vermiform\rsecond-stage juveniles (J2) of Meloidogyne moves through the soil and\rpenetrate the root behind the tip, by using their protractible stylet\rand releasing secretions containing cell-wall-degrading enzymes\r(Abad et al. 2003). J2 then migrate intercellularly between the cortical\rcells towards the root tip where they make a U-turn to later enter into\rthe vascular cylinder and moves until stablishing a feeding site. Each\rJ2 is able to induce the redifferentiation of five to seven\rparenchymatic root cells into multinucleate and hypertrophied feeding\rcells, the so-called giant cells, from which get the nutrients needed\rfor its life cycle completion (Nyczepir and Thomas 2009). The accumulation of\rthese giant cells is responsible for the characteristic galled tissue\rpresent in infected root systems, and for the disturbance of plant\rdevelopment, defenses, and metabolism (Shukla et al. 2018). Once infection\roccurs, juveniles become sedentary and assume a “sausage” shape as\rincreases its size. J2 then moults three times achieving the adult\rstage. The tropical species, M. arenaria, M. incognita and M.\rjavanica, reproduce parthenogenetically. The sedentary pearl-shaped\radult female keeps feeding from the giant cells and is able to lay c.\r300-500 eggs inside a gelatinous mass. Under unfavourable conditions\r(high nematode density, scarcity of food or stressed plants) the\rjuveniles develop into males. Interestingly, some studies have found to\rincrease stimulation towards maleness by cropping several cucurbit\rspecies (Fassuliotis 1970; Walters et al. 2006; Expósito et al. 2019).\n\rFigure 1: Diagram of the life cycle of the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne. J2: second-stage juvenile; J3: third-stage juvenile; J4: fourth-stage juvenile (adapted from Moens et al. (2009)).\r\rMeloidogyne spp. is a poikilothermic organism, meaning that\rtemperature influence its life cycle and determine its length\r(Tyler 1933). The nematode development occurs between 10 and 32 C, and\rneeds to accumulate an amount of degree-days (K) at a certain basal\rtemperature (Tb) to complete its life cycle (Trudgill 1995). For\rinstance, it has been reported that Meloidogyne spp. requires between\r600 and 700 accumulated degree-days with a base temperature of 10 C to\rcomplete its life cycle in tomato (Ferris 1985). However, the thermal\rtime requirements for life cycle completion can differ between RKN\rpopulations of a given species depending of its geographic origin,\rshowing its ability to adapt to environmental factors, i.e., optimal\rtemperatures of 25-30C and 32-34C were found in populations of M.\rjavanica from Australia and California, respectively (Ferris and Van Gundy 1979).\rSuch adaptive ability may be one of the main reasons of its success in\rspreading globally, and also evidence its importance for modern\ragriculture.\n\rEconomic importance\rThe occurrence of soilborne diseases and pests have increased in recent\ryears as consequence of the intensive cultivation needed to supply a\rgrowing population in limited land resources (Judy A. Thies, Buckner, et al. 2015). A\rcomprehensive summary of the estimation of yield losses caused by RKN in\rseveral crops have been published by Greco and Di Vito (2009).\rThe cucurbit and solanaceous crops are two of the crop families most\rfrequently cultivated worldwide that are severely affected by RKN.\rRegarding cucurbit crops, maximum yield losses of 88, 53 and 35% in\rcucumber, zucchini and watermelon, respectively, have been estimated\runder greenhouse conditions (Giné et al. 2014; Vela et al. 2014; López-Gómez et al. 2014, 2015). RKN are also one of the most\rdamaging soilborne pathogens for solanaceous crops, specially under\rprotected cultivation, with maximum yield losses of 94, 95 and 100%\rreported for pepper, eggplant and tomato, respectively (Giné et al. 2017; Hallmann and Meressa 2018).\n\r\rPopulation dynamics and yield losses\rPopulation dynamics studies the factors that determine the temporal\roscillation of densities of individuals from the same specie living in a\rcertain area. The nematode population density at sowing or transplanting\rof a crop is related with its productivity. The proper modeling of\rpopulation dynamics allows to estimate the densities variability over\rtime in relation with influencing factors, and therefore, to relate them\rwith the yield losses that nematodes could cause. Modeling the damage\rlevels enable to calculate parameters such the tolerance limit (T),\rthe maximum population density above which yield losses start to occur,\rand the maximum yield losses (m). These parameters, along with the\rmaximum reproduction rate (a)(Pf/Pi at low densities\r(Ferris 1985), and the equilibrium density, that initial population at\rwhich nematode receive just enough supply of nutrients to maintain the\rpopulation density at the same level from begin at the end of the\rgrowing season; permits to evaluate the importance of a determined\rnematode from a growing area, or the effect of management strategies.\rThese quantitative studies constitute the basis for populations’\revolution understanding of specific patosystems with typical\ragro-environmental conditions from determine growing area, and to design\rand implement effective and durable management strategies (Sorriba and\rVerdejo-Lucas 2011; Fig\r2).\n\rFigure 2: Relation between initial and final densities in experiments with a nematode on a good host, intermediate hosts, poor hosts, and a nonhost. Pi and Pf: initial and final densities on logarithmic scales. Equilibrium density: Pf = Pi (adapted from Seinhorst (1970)).\r\rPopulation density fluctuations are affected by denso-independent and\rdenso-dependent factors. Denso-independent factors, such climate,\renvironmental conditions, and intraspecific competition, influence from\routside of population, while denso-dependent include interspecific\rcompetition and the action of antagonist or predators. Two phases can be\rdistinguish: one during the host plant cultivation in which nematode\rhave enough nutrients to increase its population density, and the second\rduring either no cropping periods in which there is no food supply and\rpopulation density do not increase, or decrease depending on the\rnematode and the duration of periods with no host cultivation.\nThe multiplication growth rate (Pf/Pi), that is, the relationship\rbetween the nematode population density at transplanting (Pi) and at\rthe end of the crop (Pf) is consider a good indicator of population\rgrowth. In absence of competition between individuals for limiting\rresources, the Pf/Pi maximize (a), and the relationship with Pi\rits a straight line (Pf = aPi; thus Pf/Pi = a). However,\rincreases in Pi induce competition between individuals for healthy\rplant tissue, can induce alteration in sex differentiation or to reduce\rin female fecundity, thus Pf/Pi decreases. In the case of nematodes\rthat reproduce parthenogenetically, such Meloidogyne spp., the\rrelationship between Pf/Pi and Pi follows an inverse potential\rfunction (Pf/Pi = aPi-b, where a is the maximum multiplication\rrate, and -b is the decrease rate of the population as Pi increase).\rThe maximum multiplication rate (a) is a good indicator of the plant\rhost status to Meloidogyne. Higher values of a indicate that the plant\ris a good host and low values, a pooor host (Ferris 1985).\nThe population growth rate can also be useful to estimate the Pi at\rwhich Pf/Pi = 1, the equilibrium density (E). This can be\rcalculated from the regression equation obtained from linearizing the\rrelationship between the Pi and the multiplication rate (Pf/Pi). The\rpopulation growth rate is also a useful indicator that allows to compare\rbetween plant species and/or germplasms, as well as the effectiveness of\rcontrol methods (Talavera et al. 2009; A. Giné and Sorribas 2017; Expósito et al. 2018); Fig\r3).\n\rFigure 3: Relation between initial population density (Pi) and multiplication rate (Pf/Pi) of RKN on two hypothetical germplasms (adapted from Ferris (1985)).\r\rRegarding to crop yield losses, there are two parameters that can be\rcalculated by estimating the relationship between increasing levels of\rPi and the relative crop biomass or yield according to the Seinhort’s\rdamage model (Seinhorst 1998):\n\\[\r\\begin{aligned}\r\u0026amp;y = m + (1 - m) 0.95 ^{\\frac{Pi}{T-1}} \u0026amp; for Pi \u0026amp;\u0026gt; T \\\\\r\u0026amp;y = 1 \u0026amp; for Pi \u0026amp;\\leq T \\\\\r\u0026amp;y = m \u0026amp; for Pi \u0026amp;\\longrightarrow \\infty\\end{aligned}\r\\]\nThe nematode population density above which yield loss start to occur is\rdefined as the nematode damage threshold level or the tolerance limit of\rthe crop (T). This value, along with the the minimum relative yield\r(m) are important parameters to characterize the response of a crop\rplant to a nematode population. The parameter T manifests itself at\rsmall nematode densities and m at larger ones (Greco and Di Vito 2009); Fig\r\\[fig:Figure107\\]).\nwidth=0.9 \\[fig:Figure107\\]\n\rPlant resistance\rThe most commonly used strategy for RKN management has been, until\rrecent years, the use of fumigant and non fumigant nematicides\r(Nyczepir and Thomas 2009). However, regulations such the European directive\r2009/128/EC and the U.S. Clean Air Act ( 2012)), have brought\rspecial attention on the research and development of environmentally\rfriendlier management strategies. A promising alternative strategy\rinvolves the use of resistant plants, those whose have the ability to\rsuppress infection development, and/or reproduction of plant-parasitic\rnematodes (Roberts 2009). Plant resistance has proven to be effective\rand economically profitable (Sorribas et al. 2005)), and also reduce yield\rlosses of the follwing crop (Ornat, Verdejo-Lucas, and Sorribas 1997); (Talavera et al. 2009);\r(Westphal 2011); (Judy A. Thies, Ariss, et al. 2015); (A. Giné and Sorribas 2017); (Expósito et al. 2019).\nThe resistance levels of a determined plant germplasm can be categorized\rin relation to a susceptible standard (Hadisoeganda 1982). Expressed\ras the percentage of RKN reproduction compared to that in a susceptible\rstandard, this parameter is called the reproduction index (RI; Fig\r\\[fig:Figure104\\]).\nwidth=0.9 \\[fig:Figure104\\]\nDespite its advantages, the expression of plant resistance can be\raffected by several factors, such the genetic background of the plant\rcultivar and/or the nematode species or population (Cortada et al. 2008). The\rselection of virulent nematode populations due to repeated cultivation\rof the same resistance gene (Verdejo-Lucas et al. 2009); (A. Giné and Sorribas 2017);\r(Expósito et al. 2019). Moreover, there are only a few resistance genes\rintrogressed into commercial solanaceous cultivars at present, and none\rin cucurbits. That are, the Me1, Me3 and N gene in pepper, and the\rMi1.2 gene in tomato. Soil temeprature can also affect the expression\rof plant resistance. It is known that the Mi1.2 gene is affected at\rsoil temperatures above 30 C, while the resistance of the N gene is\rreported to be partially lost at 32 C (Araujo et al. 1982);\r(Thies and Fery 1998). Thus,plant resistance is a valuable management tool but\rit should be used in a proper manner to maximize its effectiveness.\rMoreover, more research are needed to identify new resistance sources\rfor increasing the R-genes that could be used in rotation schemes .\nGrafting vegetables onto resistant rootstocks is an effective method to\rcontrol soilborne pathogens when no commercial cultivars are available\r(Miguel et al. 2004); (Cohen et al. 2007); (Thies et al. 2016); (Kumar, Bharti, and Saravaiya 2018). This control\rmethod was essentially rediscovered in the past two decades and quickly\rexpanded to become a common practice at the present (Judy A. Thies, Buckner, et al. 2015);\r(Kyriacou et al. 2017). Grafting has expanded mainly in the Cucurbitaceae and\rthe Solanaceae families (Moncada et al. 2013). The use of anatomical and\rphysiological compatible graft combinations improve the plant\rperformance under biotic or abiotic stress conditions when compared with\rthat of the ungrafted scion, allowing rapid response to new pathogen\rraces without the prolonged screening and selection required for\rbreeding resistance into cultivars (Davis et al. 2008). Although the\rtolerance and resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, respectively,\ralong with an increasing productivity have been the main drivers of\rrootstock selection and breeding, the effect of grafting on fruit\rquality is also another important factor to take into account\r(Kyriacou et al. 2017).\nSome strategies proposed to avoid the selection for RKN virulence or to\rreduce the level of virulence and crop yield losses consider to include\rresistant and susceptible crops in rotation sequences\r(Talavera et al. 2009)), the use of crops of two different resistant plant\rspecies (Expósito et al. 2019)), or to pyramid different R-genes\r(Djian-Caporalino et al. 2014). However, as literature reviewed points out, most of the\rresearch done have been focusing on tomato and pepper. Thus, the aim of\rthis thesis was to increase the diversity of resistance sources against\rRKN by potentially effective rootstocks for two species of the most\reconomically important botanical families cultivated, the cucurbitaseous\rwatermelon (Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus), and the solanaseous\reggplant (Solanum melongena). A brief description of these two crops\rand their potential rootstocks is presented in the next two sections.\nwidth=\nimage\n\r. \\[fig:Figure108\\]\n2\n\rWatermelon\rImportance\rWatermelon is the most cultivated cucurbit crop worldwide. The global\rproduction in 2017 was ca. 118 million t in ca. 3.4 million ha, 38% of\rthe arable land destined to cultivate for this botanical family, with an\restimated value of 48.9B (FAOSTAT 2017); Fig\r\\[fig:Figure108\\]). In spite of its origin theorized in the\rAfrican continent, most of the watermelon are produced in Asia, with 67%\rof total world production in China. Within the European Union (EU),\rSpain was the main watermelon producer during 2017, with 20,026 ha\rharvested to produce 1.1 million t of fruit marketed with an estimated\rvalue of 331M, 68% of which were exported (MAPA 2019). The watermelon\rfruit composition is 93% water, with small amounts of protein, fat,\rminerals, and vitamins. The major nutritional fruit components are\rcarbohydrates (6.4 g/100 g), vitamin A (590 IU), and lycopene (4,100\r\\(\\mu\\)g/100g, range 2300–7200), an anticarcinogenic compound found in\rred flesh watermelon, even in higher amounts than in tomato, pink\rgrapefruit, or guava (Wehner 2008).\n\rOrigin\rWatermelon is a diploid creeping monoecious crop that belongs to the\rCucurbitaceae family. The taxonomy of the genus Citrullus have had\rmajor misapplication of names until recent years, including that of\rwatermelon, C. lanatus, itself (Chomicki and Renner 2015); (Renner, Chomicki, and Greuter 2014). The\rSouthern African region is reported to be the center of diversity and\rprobably the center of origin of most of the Citrullus species\r(Dane and Lang 2004); (Rubatsky 2001); (Robinson and Decker-Walters 1997). However, four\rhypotheses have been proposed for the origin of watermelon: i) that it\rdescends from the northern African colocynth (C. colocynthis,\r(Singh 1978); (Sain, Joshi, and Divakara Sastry 2002); (McCreight et al. 2013). ii) That it derives from\rthe South African citron melon, C. amarus, previously referred as C.\rlanatus var. citroides (Robinson and Decker-Walters 1997); (Maynard and Maynard 2000);\r(Rubatsky 2001); (Chomicki and Renner 2015). iii) That it stems from the West\rAfrican C. mucosospermus (Guo et al. 2013); (Chomicki and Renner 2015)), and iv) Recent\rresearch with polygenomic analyses of nuclear gene sequences suggest\rthat the white-fleshed Sudanese Kordophan melon (Citrullus vulgaris)\ris the closest relative of domesticated watermelon that was originated\rand domesticated in north-eastern Africa (Renner et al. 2019); Fig\r\\[fig:Figure108\\]).\n\rCultivation challenges\rThe modern cultivated watermelon has a narrow genetic base\r(Szamosi et al. 2009); (Solmaz et al. 2010); (Nimmakayala et al. 2014)) attributed to many\ryears of domestication and selection of its desirable horticultural\rtraits such as red-scarlet flesh color and sweetness (Levi, Thomas, Wehner, et al. 2001);\r(Hwang et al. 2011); (Lambel et al. 2014); (Nimmakayala et al. 2014). The continued use of\rcultivars with narrow genetic base for breeding resulted in reduced gene\rdiversity among American watermelon accessions (Wang et al. 2015);\r(Zhang et al. 2016). This has derived in susceptibility of crops to random and\remerging biotic and abiotic stresses (Levi, Thomas, Keinath, et al. 2001); (Mo et al. 2016). In spite\rof being consider a less suitable host for RKN than other cucurbit\rcrops, watermelon maximum yield losses of 37% have been recently\rreported in Spain (López-Gómez et al. 2014). Moreover, as the next section\rwill better describe, modern watermelons are commonly grafted onto\rcommercial rootstocks owing its resistance to fusarium, however, these\rrootstocks are not resistant to Meloidogyne\r(Kokalis-Burelle and Rosskopf 2011; López-Gómez, Talavera, and Verdejo-Lucas 2016; Giné et al. 2017).\n\rGrafting\rA detailed history of cucurbit grafting have been done by Davis\r((2008). The primary motive for grafting cucurbits is to avoid\rdamage caused by soilborne pests and pathogens when genetic or chemical\rapproaches for disease management are not available (Oda 2002).\rResearch on cucurbit grafting began in the 1920s with the use of\rCucurbita moschata as a rootstock for watermelon, but then bottle\rgourd (Lagenaria siceraria) soon became the preferred rootstock. By\rthe year 1998, approximately 95% of watermelon and oriental melons were\rgrafted onto squash or bottlegourd rootstocks in Japan, Korea, and\rTaiwan (Oda and Lee 2003). Possibly because of the widespread use of bottle\rgourd rootstocks, there are reports of plants affected by Fusarium wilt,\rprobably the most common and damaging soilborne disease of cucurbit\rcrops worldwide, caused by Fusarium oxysporum Schltdl. Moreover both\rrootstocks are susceptible to Meloidogyne infection\r(Kokalis-Burelle and Rosskopf 2011); (López-Gómez, Talavera, and Verdejo-Lucas 2016); (Giné et al. 2017). Hence, an\ralternative genetic source of resistance to both pathogens must be found\rand properly characterized in order to be able to design an effective\rand widely applicable RKN management strategy.\nA potential alternative rootstock for watermelon, is its close relative\rcitron or preserving melon, C. amarus. The flesh of the citron is\rwhite or green, and may vary from bland to bitter tasting. Its rind is\rused to make pickles, and the fruit are feeding to livestock\r(Wehner 2008). Conversely to watermelon, citron melon exhibits wider\rgenetic variation (Levi, Thomas, Wehner, et al. 2001)) suggesting its genetic worthiness as a\rsource of valuable genes for breeding (Ngwepe, Mashilo, and Shimelis 2019). This rootstock\rhave show to be resistant to several soil pathogens such as fusarium\rwilt, gummy stem blight, powdery mildew, potyviruses, and some species\rand populations of Meloidogyne (Gusmini, Song, and Wehner 2005); (Huitrón et al. 2007);\r(Guner and Wehner 2008); (Tetteh, Wehner, and Davis 2010); (Thies et al. 2016). In spite of it, there is\rlittle information about it use to control RKN in the EU, thus, research\ron its response to local population must be done before include it in a\rmanagement strategy.\n\r\rEggplant\rImportance\rEggplant, Solanum melongena, is the third most widely cultivated\rSolanaceous fruiting crop after potato and tomato. The global production\rin 2017 was ca. 52 million t in ca. 1.8 million ha, 7% of the arable\rland destined to cultivate for this family, with an estimated value of\r36.2B. Most of eggplants production is made in China and India, with ca.\r87% of global production done there in 2017. Italy, Spain and Romania\rwere the top three eggplant producer countries in the EU, with 286,473,\r225,912 and 124,429 t produced, respectively (FAOSTAT 2017); Fig\r\\[fig:Figure111\\]). Eggplant is not high in the majority of\rhealth-related micronutrients, but it is very low in fat an calorie and\ra rich source of nutritionally and pharmaceutically useful compounds,\rsuch a number phytonutrients, especially hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA)\rconjugates, potentially involved in consumer health, fruit taste and\rtexture (Meyer et al. 2015); (Chapman 2019).\n\rOrigin\rThe Asian eggplant is a widely grown species from the Solanaceae\rfamily. Eggplant is especially popular in the Southeast Asia and the\rMediterranean region . Several non-exclusive theories have been proposed\rregarding eggplant’s origin. The general consensus (Weese and Bohs 2010);\r(Knapp, Vorontsova, and Prohens 2013)) is that the African/Middle Eastern species S. incanum\rwas transported into Indo-China where the true wild progenitor, S.\rinsanum, evolved, from which S. melongena is derived\r(Chapman 2019).\n\rCultivation challenges\rThe commercial eggplant cultivars also have a narrow genetic diversity\rthat, is even poorer than for other solanaceous crops such as tomato and\rpepper. A list of eggplant diseases and pests, and resistances described\rhas been well summarized by Daunay ((2008). Among the most\rcommon soil borne diseases affecting eggplants are bacterial, fusarium\rand verticillium wilt, caused by Ralstonia solanacearum, Fusarium\roxysporum f. sp. melongenae, Verticillium dahliae and V.\ralbo-atrum. Moreover, it is also susceptible to RKN.\n\rGrafting\rEggplant grafting is mostly used in intensive production conditions. As\rDaunay ((2008)) well summarize, there are currently three types\rof eggplant rootstock: i) S. melongena lines and hybrids that resist\rto Fusarium and bacterial wilt, and Phomopsis blight, ii) rootstocks\rbased on the use of S. integrifolium, which also resists to Fusarium\rand bacterial wilts, and is used directly as a rootstock or as parent\rcrossed with S. melongena varieties for producing interspecific hybrid\rrootstocks (S. integrifolium \\(\\times\\) S. melongena), and iii) the\rthird type of rootstocks is composed by Solanum species such S.\rtorvum and S. sanitswongsei. However, within Europe eggplant is\rgrafted mostly onto tomato or tomato interspecific hybrids (L.\resculentum \\(\\times\\) L. hirsutum).\nSolanum torvum is a wild relative of eggplant that is resistant to V.\rdahliae, R. solanacearum, F. oxysporum f. sp. Melongenae, and\rsome RKN populations (Singh and Gopalakrishnan 1997); (Bletsos, Thanassoulopoulos, and Roupakias 2003); (Daunay 2008);\r(Gisbert et al. 2011). Although resistance of S. torvum rootstocks to M.\rincognita have been consistently described against several populations\rfrom France (Daunay and Dalmasso 1985)), India (Shetty and Reddy 1985); (Dhivya, Sadasakthi, and Sivakumar 2014)),\rJapan (Hara et al. 1983); (Ali et al. 1992)), Pakistan (Rahman et al. 2002)) and Turkey\r(Çürük et al. 2009)); several studies found discrepancies on the levels of\rresistance to M. arenaria (Daunay and Dalmasso 1985); Gonzalez et al; 2010; Ryu et\ral., 2011; (Uehara, Tateishi, et al. 2017); (Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018)) and M. javanica\r(Daunay and Dalmasso 1985); (Boiteux and Charchar 1996); (Tzortzakakis, Bletsos, and Avgelis 2006); (Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018). As\rfar as literature reviewed pointed out, there are no enough studies that\rwidely characterize the response of S. torvum against Meloidogyne\rpopulations occurring in Spain.\nMost of grafting application have expanded mainly in the Cucurbitaceae\rand Solanaceae family, both major vegetable crops that are commonly\rrotated to maximize land use and boost productivity\r(López-Gómez et al. 2015); (Kyriacou et al. 2017). The proper screening of C.\ramarus and S. torvum rootstocks could give crucial information about\rpotential tools already available to design effective and\renvironmentally friendlier strategies to managing RKN. In particular,\rthis work will focus on Meloidogyne populations ocurrying in Spain,\rsome of them previously described as virulents to the Mi1.2 gene in\rtomato (Ornat, Verdejo-Lucas, and Sorribas 2007); (Verdejo-Lucas, Talavera, and Andrés 2012).\nwidth=\nimage\n\r\\[fig:Figure111\\]\n2\n\r\rObjectives\rThe main objective of this thesis was to determine the durability of\rresistance to Meloidogyne of Citrullus amarus and Solanum torvum\ras potential rootstocks for watermelon and eggplant, respectively.

In the pot\rexperiments, plants were inoculated with a second-stage juvenile per\rcm3 of sterile sand and maintained in a growth chamber at 25 C for 50\rdays. The watermelon cv. Sugar Baby was included as a susceptible\rcontrol for comparison. At the end of the experiments, the number of egg\rmasses and eggs per plant was determined, and the reproduction index was\rcalculated as the percentage of the number of eggs produced in the C.\ramarus accessions with regard to that produced in the susceptible cv.\rSugar Baby. In the plastic greenhouse experiment, the ungrafted\rwatermelon cv. Sugar Baby and watermelons grafted onto each of the C.\ramarus accessions and onto the watermelon rootstock cv. Robusta were\rcultivated from May to August 2016 in plots with nematode densities from\r46 to 1392 J2 per 250 cm3 of soil at transplantation. At the end of\rthe experiment, the galling index and the number of eggs per plant were\rdetermined, and the reproduction index was calculated. Additionally, the\rcompatibility of the two accessions with the watermelon cv. Sugar Baby\rand the effect on fruit quality (weight, size, shape, firmness, pH,\rtotal soluble solids, and flesh color) were assessed under a hydroponic\rsystem in a greenhouse. The commercial rootstocks cv. Cobalt and cv.\rRobusta were also included. All the Meloidogyne isolates produced less\regg masses and eggs per plant on the accessions than on Sugar Baby. Both\raccessions performed as resistant against M. arenaria, and from highly\rto moderately resistant to M. incognita and M. javanica in pot\rexperiments. In the plastic greenhouse experiment, both C. amarus\raccessions performed as resistant to M. incognita. Both C. amarus\raccessions were compatible with the watermelon cv. Sugar Baby, but only\rthe BGV0005167 accession did not influence the fruit quality. Then, the\rBGV0005167 accession is a promising rootstock for managing the three\rtropical root-knot nematode species without influencing watermelon fruit\rquality.\n2\nIntroduction\rWatermelon is one of the major cultivated cucurbit crops, with an\restimated worldwide production of ca. 117 million t from 3.5 million ha\r(FAOSTAT 2017). As a result of the intensive cultivation in limited\rland resources, soilborne diseases and pests have significantly\rincreased in recent years (Judy A. Thies, Buckner, et al. 2015). The root-knot nematode (RKN)\rMeloidogyne spp. is currently one of the main pathogens in cucurbit\rcrops. Maximum yield losses of 88% in cucumber, 53% in zucchini, and 35%\rin watermelon cultivated under plastic greenhouses have been estimated\rin Spain (Giné et al. 2014); (Vela et al. 2014); (López-Gómez et al. 2014),\r(2015). The control of RKN has widely been done using\rfumigant and non fumigant nematicides (Nyczepir and Thomas 2009). Nonetheless,\rthe interest in nonchemical control alternatives has increased according\rto recent regulations such as the European Directive 2009/128/EC and the\rU.S. Clean Air Act ( 2012). In this scenario, plant resistance is\ra key tool for RKN management because it is an effective and\reconomically profitable control method (Sorribas et al. 2005). Cropping\rresistant cultivars reduces the growth rate and the equilibrium density\rof the RKN population, as well as crop yield losses (Talavera et al. 2009).\rMoreover, it reduces crop yield losses of the following crop in the\rrotation scheme (Ornat, Verdejo-Lucas, and Sorribas 1997); (Thies et al. 2004); (Westphal 2011).\rGrafting onto resistant rootstocks is an alternative method to control\rsoilborne pathogens when no commercial resistant cultivars are available\r(Yetişir, Sari, and Yücel 2003); (Miguel et al. 2004); (Cohen et al. 2007); (Oda 2002); (Thies et al. 2016).\rRegarding watermelon, it has been commonly grafted onto commercial\rrootstocks such as Cucurbita maxima \\(\\times\\) Cucurbita moschata and\rLagenaria siceraria owing to their resistance to fusarium wilt.\rHowever, both rootstocks are susceptible to infection by Meloidogyne\r(Davis et al. 2008); (Hassell, Memmott, and Liere 2008); (Thies et al. 2010), (2015)a;\r(Kokalis-Burelle and Rosskopf 2011); (López-Gómez, Talavera, and Verdejo-Lucas 2016); (Giné et al. 2017). In the last\rfew years, some accessions of citron melon, Citrullus lanatus var.\rcitroides, most recently referred as Citrullus amarus\r(Chomicki and Renner 2015)), have been proven to be useful as watermelon\rrootstock. Indeed, these accessions provide resistance to fusarium wilt\r(Huitrón et al. 2007); (Levi et al. 2017)) and some RKN species in both greenhouse\r(Thies and Levi 2003), (2007)) and open field cultivation\r(Huitrón et al. 2007); (Thies et al. 2010), (2015)a, (2016). In\raddition, watermelon grafted onto C. amarus yielded more than those\rgrafted onto L. siceraria, C. maxima \\(\\times\\) C. moschata or\rPraecitrullus fistulosus, without affecting the quality and the size\rof the fruits (Kyriacou et al. 2016); (Judy A. Thies, Ariss, et al. 2015)a; (Fredes et al. 2017). However,\rnot all C. amarus accessions responded equally to RKN isolates\r(Thies and Levi 2003), (2007); (Thies et al. 2016); (Levi et al. 2017)), the screening\rof new accessions against local RKN populations being necessary to\rassure their efficacy. Furthermore, the compatibility with the scion and\rthe effect on the quality of fruits is also required to be considered as\ra potential rootstock. The aim of this study was to characterize the\rresponse of two experimental C. amarus accessions against several\risolates of Meloidogyne arenaria, Meloidogyne incognita and\rMeloidogyne javanica under controlled conditions and against M.\rincognita under plastic greenhouse conditions. Additionally, the\rcompatibility of the two C. amarus accessions with the watermelon cv.\rSugar Baby and the effect on fruit quality were assessed in a hydroponic\rsystem under greenhouse.\n\rMaterials and methods\rNematode inoculum\rSeven isolates of M. arenaria, M. incognita and M. javanica were\rused in the experiments (Table 1.1). All the RKN isolates were maintained on the\rsusceptible tomato cv. Durinta (Seminis Seeds, St. Louis, Missouri).\rSecond-stage juveniles (J2) were used as the inoculum. The J2 were\robtained from eggs by maceration of the infected roots in a 5%\rcommercial bleach solution (40 g/L NaOCl) for 10 min according to the\rHussey and Barker ((1973)) method. After maceration,\rthe egg suspension was filtered through a 74 \\(\\mu\\)m sieve, and then, the\reggs were collected on a 25 \\(\\mu\\)m sieve and placed on Baermann trays\r(Whitehead and Hemming 1965). The J2 emerged during the first 24 h were\rdiscarded. After that, the J2 emerged were recovered every two days and\rmaintained at 9 C until the pot experiments were carried out. The\ridentification of the Meloidogyne species was confirmed using SCAR-PCR\rmarkers (Zijlstra, Donkers-Venne, and Fargette 2000).\n\rMeloidogyne species and isolates used in pot experiments,\rgeographic origin, and (a)virulence status against the Mi1.2 gene of\rtomato.\r\rMeloidogyne spp.\rIsolate\rGeographic origin\r(a)virulence\rReference\r\r\r\rM. arenaria\rMA68\rBarcelona\rAvirulent\r(Expósito et al. 2018)\r\rM. incognita\rAgropolis\rBarcelona\rAvirulent\r(Giné et al. 2017)\r\r\rGarriga\rBarcelona\rAvirulent\r(Expósito et al. 2018)\r\rM. javanica\rMJ05\rBarcelona\rAvirulent\r(Ornat, Verdejo-Lucas, and Sorribas 2007)\r\r\rTugues\rBarcelona\rAvirulent\r(Expósito et al. 2018)\r\r\rBay\rMurcia\rAvirulent\r(Expósito et al. 2018)\r\r\rMJLg\rAlmería\rVirulent\r(Expósito et al. 2018)\r\r\r\r\r2\n\rResponse of C. amarus accessions to RKN isolates\rThe C. amarus accessions BGV0005164 (CI64) and BGV0005167 (CI67),\robtained from Institute for the Conservation and Breeding of\rAgricultural Biodiversity (COMAV-UPV) gene bank collection (Valencia,\rSpain), were assessed against the Meloidogyne isolates in three\rdifferent pot experiments. In the first experiment, the accessions CI64\rand CI67 were assessed against the Mi1.2 avirulent isolates Agropolis\r(M. incognita) and MJ05 (M. javanica). In the second experiment, the\rresponse of the two C. amarus accessions was assessed against the\rMi1.2 avirulent isolates MA68 of M. arenaria; Agropolis and Garriga\rof M. incognita; and Bay, MJ05, and Tugues of M. javanica. In the\rthird experiment, the response of both C. amarus accessions was\rassessed against the Mi1.2 virulent isolate MJLg of M. javanica. The\rwatermelon cv. Sugar Baby (SB) (Intersemillas S. A., Loriguilla,\rValencia, Spain) was included as susceptible control for comparison in\rall experiments. The watermelon rootstock cv. Robusta (RO) (C.\rlanatus, Intersemillas S. A., Loriguilla, Valencia, Spain) was also\rincluded for comparison as resistant control (López-Gómez, Talavera, and Verdejo-Lucas 2016)) in the\rthird experiment. Experiment 1 and 3 were carried out once, and each\rplant-RKN isolate combination was replicated 10 times. Experiment 2 was\rrepeated once, and each plant-RKN isolate combination was replicated\rseven and eight times in the first and second experiment repetition,\rrespectively.\n\rAll experiments were carried out following the same procedure. Briefly,\rseeds were germinated according to the method given in Exposito et al.\r((2018). Seedlings were transplanted to 200 cm\\(^{3}\\) pots\rcontaining sterile sand and maintained in a growth chamber at 25 \\(\\pm\\)\r2C with a 16:8 h (light:dark) photoperiod for a week and then inoculated\rwith 1 J2 per cm\\(^{3}\\) soil. Plants were maintained in the growth\rchamber for 50 days. Plants were watered as needed throughout the\rexperiment and fertilized with a slow-release fertilizer (15% N, 9%\rP\\(_{2}\\)O\\(_{5}\\), 12% K\\(_{2}\\)O, 2% MgO\\(_{2}\\), microelements; Osmocote\rPlus). Soil temperatures were recorded daily at 30 min intervals with a\rPT100 probe (Campbell Scientific Ltd.) placed into the pots at 4 cm\rdepth.\nAt the end of the experiments, the roots were carefully washed and\rweighed. Then, in the first and second experiments, the roots were\rsubmerged in 15 mg/L erioglaucine solution (Acros Organics) for 20 min\rto stain the egg masses before counting them (Omwega 1988). In all\rexperiments, eggs were extracted from roots by maceration in a 10%\rcommercial bleach solution (40 g/L NaOCl) for 10 min\r(Hussey and Barker 1973)), passed through a 74 \\(\\mu\\)m aperture screen\rand collected in a 25 \\(\\mu\\)m sieve for final counting. Reproduction\rindex (RI) was calculated as the percentage of eggs per plant produced\rin the experimental germplasm with regard to that in the susceptible\rone. The response of the accessions was categorized according to the RI\ras highly resistant (RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 1%), resistant (1% \\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 10%),\rmoderately resistant (10% \\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 25%), slightly resistant (25%\r\\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 50%), or susceptible (RI \\(\\geq\\) 50%)\r(Hadisoeganda 1982).\n\r\rExperiment under plastic greenhouse\rThe experiment was carried out from May 10 to August 11, 2016, under a\r700 m2 plastic greenhouse located at Viladecans (Barcelona, Spain),\rinfested with the M. incognita isolate Agropolis. Ten 2.5 m long\rindividual plots were used. Each plot was considered a replication and\rconsisted in a row in which one plant each of ungrafted watermelon SB,\rthe watermelon grafted onto CI64 and CI67, and that grafted onto the\rrootstock RO was transplanted with a space of 0.6 m. Plants were\rarranged in such a way that every germplasm was an equal number of times\rat the edge of the plots and next to the susceptible SB. Plants were\rirrigated as needed through a drip irrigation system and weekly\rfertilized with a solution consisting of NPK (15-5-30) at 31 kg/ha and\riron chelate and micronutrients at 0.9 kg/ha. Plants were maintained for\r20 weeks. The temperature was recorded at 30 min interval with\rtemperature probes 5TM (Decagon Devices, Inc.) placed at a depth of 15\rcm in the soil.\nNematode densities were determined at transplantation (Pi). Soil\rsamples were taken from each experimental plot and consisted of eight\rcores taken from the first 30 cm of soil with an auger of diameter 2.5\rcm. Soil subsamples were mixed and passed through a 4 mm pore sieve to\rremove stones. The J2 were extracted from 500 cm3 of soil using\rBaermann trays (Whitehead and Hemming 1965)) and incubated at 27 \\(\\pm\\) 2 C for one\rweek. Afterwards, the J2 were collected using a 25 \\(\\mu\\)m aperture\rscreen, counted, and expressed as J2 per 250 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil. At the\rend of the experiment, roots were carefully removed from the soil,\rwashed, and weighed, and the galling index (GI) was evaluated on a scale\rfrom 0 to 10, where 0 complete and healthy root system and 10 plants and\rroots dead (Zeck 1971). After that, the number of eggs per plant was\rdetermined as described previously and was considered the final nematode\rdensity (Pf). RI was calculated and the response of the C. amarus\raccessions and RO was categorized as described previously.\n\rGrafting compatibility and fruit quality\rThe watermelon cultivar SB was self-grafted (SB-SB) and grafted onto\rCI64, CI67, RO, and the commercial hybrid C. maxima \\(\\times\\) C.\rmoschata rootstock cv. Cobalt (CO) (Rijk Zwaan, BV, The Netherlands)\raccording to the cleft procedure (Lee et al., 2010). Ten plants of each\rgrafted combination were grown under a hydroponic system in a commercial\rgreenhouse at Fundación Cajamar (Paiporta, Valencia) during the\rspring–summer 2018. The ungrafted watermelon SB was included for\rcomparison. To evaluate the impact of grafting on fruit quality, ten\rfruits per treatment were characterized for the following traits:\rweight, length and width, rind and flesh thickness, flesh firmness\r(measured with a digital Penetrometer (8 mm) FHT-803, Melrose, MA), pH\r(measured with the pH indicator paper pH1-14; Merck, Darmstadt,\rGermany), total soluble solids (quantified using the digital\rrefractometer Atago, Tokyo, Japan), and flesh color (measured with the\rcolorimeter Minolta CR-400, New Jersey, USA) using the color parameters\rHunter L, a and b, where the L value indicates lightness (from 0 to\r100), a value indicates redness (+) or greenness (\\(-\\)), and b value\rindicates yellowness (+) or blueness (\\(-\\)).\n\rStatistical analysis\rStatistical analyses were performed using R Statistical Software version\r3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The\rdata on the number of egg masses and eggs per plant were not normally\rdistributed according to the normal Shapiro–Wilk W test. Data from\rboth repetitions of the second experiment were submitted to the\rnonparametric Mann–Whitney U test and pooled together as replications\rof the same experiment because no differences were found (P \\(\\geq\\)\r0.05). Comparisons between plant germplasm per each RKN isolate, as well\ras between RKN isolates per each plant germplasm within each experiment\rwere done by the Mann–Whitney U test (two groups) or the\rKruskal–Wallis non parametric test (more than two groups). When\rsignificant (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05), medians were separated using pairwise\rmultiple comparisons by the Dunn test (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05). Data on fruit\rquality traits of each grafted combination were compared to those of the\rungrafted control SB by the Student t-test (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05)\n\r\rResults\rPot experiments\rThe number of egg masses and eggs per plant was lower (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05) in\rboth C. amarus accessions than in the watermelon SB, irrespective of\rthe RKN isolate. Both C. amarus accessions responded as resistant (1%\r\\(\\leq\\) RI $\u0026lt;$10%) to the majority of the RKN isolates. The accession\rCI64 responded only as moderately resistant to the M. javanica isolate\rTugues, and both CI67 and RO were moderately resistant to the Mi1.2\rvirulent MJLg isolate of M. javanica (Table\r\\[tab:table202\\]).\n\rExperiment under plastic greenhouse\rThe minimum and maximum soil temperatures during the experiment were\r18.4 C and 30.5 C, respectively. The initial nematode densities at\rtransplantation ranged from 46 to 1392 J2 per 250 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil. The\rnumber of eggs per plant and the galling index were significantly lower\r(P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05) in both C. amarus accessions than those in the\rwatermelon SB and the rootstock RO. Both CI accession and the rootstock\rRO performed as resistant (1% \\(\\leq\\) RI $\u0026lt;$10%) to M. incognita (Table\r1.2).\n\rGrafting compatibility and fruit quality\rUnder our experimental conditions, both ungrafted watermelon SB and\rwatermelon SB grafted onto different rootstocks showed a similar growth\rperformance. However, some effects of fruit traits were observed in\rplants grafted onto specific rootstocks (Table\r\\[tab:table204\\]). The weight of watermelon fruits produced by\rSB onto the Cucurbita hybrid rootstock CO was greater (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05)\rthan the weight of those produced by the ungrafted plants (5.5 \\(\\pm\\) 0.2\rvs. 4.7 \\(\\pm\\) 0.5 kg) but with a significant decrease (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05)\rof soluble solids (9.45 \\(\\pm\\) 0.27 vs. 10.67 \\(\\pm\\) 0.32 Bx). The\rwatermelon rootstocks RO and CI67 did not influence the fruit traits\rcompared to those produced by the ungrafted and self-grafted SB, but the\rrootstock CI64 produced fruits with thicker rinds, firmer flesh, and\rless soluble solids (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05) (Table\r\\[tab:table204\\]).\nData are the mean \\(\\pm\\) standard error of 10 replicates in experiments 1\rand 3 and of 15 replicates in experiment 2.

Some other C. amarus accessions\rresistant to RKN have been reported previously (Huitrón et al. 2007);\r(Judy A. Thies, Levi, et al. 2015)), thus increasing the number of accessions that could be\rused as putative watermelon rootstock. The watermelon has been described\ras a poor host of Meloidogyne owing to its low values of maximum\rmultiplication rate and equilibrium density (López-Gómez et al. 2014). The\rRKN isolates assessed in this study reproduced less than watermelon cv.\rSugar Baby in both pot and plastic greenhouse experiments, which\rdemonstrates their potential for suppressing the RKN population growth\rrate. Other C. amarus accessions and lines have also been shown to be\rRKN resistant under field and plastic greenhouse conditions\r(Huitrón et al. 2007); (Thies et al. 2008), (2009), (2015)a,\r(2015)b, (2015)c). The resistance of C. amarus to RKN\rhas been associated with the relatively high root fibrosity compared to\rthat of C. lanatus var. lanatus, Citrullus colocynthis, L.\rsiceraria, and C. maxima \\(\\times\\) C. moschata (Thies and Levi 2003),\r(2007); (Judy A. Thies, Levi, et al. 2015), (2016).\n\rInterestingly, both C. amarus accessions assessed in this study were\ralso resistant to a Mi1.2 gene virulent isolate. This finding shows\rthe usefulness to include this germplasm as a component of the rotation\rscheme for managing virulent RKN isolates for specific resistance genes.\rThe most available resistance genes to RKN in vegetables are in\rsolanaceous cultivars and rootstocks, e.g., tomato and pepper. The\rvirulence to a given R-gene could be counter-selected by other\rR-genes because it is highly specific and it has a fitness cost to be\racquired (Djian-Caporalino et al. 2011). Recently, some Cucumis\rmetuliferus accessions have been described as resistant to Mi1.2 gene\rvirulent RKN isolates (Expósito et al. 2018)), and although the selection for\rvirulence to the Mi1.2 gene was not prevented when alternated with\rtomato grafted onto the resistant rootstock cv. Aligator, it influenced\rits level (Expósito et al. 2019). The availability of some more sources of\rresistance used in rotation schemes could favor the durability of\rspecific resistant genes by preventing the fixation of the virulence\rcharacter in the RKN population.\nGrafting commercial watermelon cultivars onto resistant rootstocks has\rproven to be a successful approach to manage plant diseases, being a\rwidely accepted practice in some parts of the world (Oda 2002);\r(Miguel et al. 2004); (Cohen et al. 2007); (Yetişir et al. 2007); (Leonardi et al. 2017).\rCucurbita hybrids, the most popular watermelon rootstocks, are resistant\rto some soil-borne fungal diseases but susceptible to RKN\r(López-Gómez, Talavera, and Verdejo-Lucas 2016); (Giné et al. 2017). The results of this study showed\rthat both C. amarus accessions are able to suppress RKN at the same\rlevel as that of the commercial C. lanatus cv. Robusta. In addition,\rthese two experimental accessions have also been proved to be moderately\rto highly resistant to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (Fon) races\r0 and 2 (Garces et al., personal communication), which improve their\rsuccess as watermelon rootstock. Some other C. amarus accessions also\rshowed resistance to other diseases such as gummy stem blight\r(Gusmini, Song, and Wehner 2005)), powdery mildew (Davis et al. 2007); (Tetteh, Wehner, and Davis 2010)), and\rpotyviruses (Guner 2004); (Strange et al. 2002); (Guner and Wehner 2008))\n\r\rBoth C. amarus accessions have shown efficient grafting compatibility\rto watermelon, but they differed in influencing the fruit quality. While\rthe quality of fruit produced by the watermelon grafted onto the CI67\raccession did not show significant difference from that produced by the\rungrafted and self-grafted plants, it did show a significant difference\rwhen grafted onto CI64. Similar results were obtained with the\rwatermelon F1 hybrid cv. Oneida onto CI67 (Fredes et al. 2017). This\rprevious study also showed that the citron melon accession affected the\raroma of the watermelon flesh less than the hybrid Cucurbita rootstock,\rwhich, in turn, produced larger fruit with less soluble solids.\n\r\rConclusion\rThe C. amarus accession CI67 is a promising rootstock for managing the\rthree tropical RKN species without influencing watermelon fruit quality.\n\rAcknowledgments\rThe authors thank MINECO and FEDER for funding projects\rAGL2013-49040-C2-1-R, AGL2014-53398-C2-2-R-AR, AGL2017-89785-R, and\rAGL2017-85563-C2-1-R-AR.

García-Mendívil and Francisco J. Sorribas\nAbstract\nThe response of ungrafted and grafted watermelon cv. Sugar baby onto the\rC. amarus accessions BGV0005164 and BGV0005167 submitted to increasing\rdensities of M. incognita and M. javanica was studied in pot\rexperiments to determine the maximum multiplication rate, the maximum\rpopulation density and the equilibrium density of the root-knot nematode\rspecies and the effect on shoot dry biomass of watermelon. In plastic\rgreenhouse conditions, the ungrafted and grafted watermelon onto both\rC. amarus accessions, and onto the C. lanatus rootstock cv. Robusta\rwere cultivated for two consecutive years in the same plots to assess\rthe level of resistance to M. incognita and crop yield. Additionally,\rafter the second crop, the putative selection for virulence in the\rnematode subpopulation originated in the ungrafted and grafted\rwatermelon was assessed in pot experiments. The maximum multiplication\rrate, the maximum population density and the equilibrium density values\rof both Meloidogyne species were lower in grafted than ungrafted\rwatermelon. In the plastic greenhouse experiment, the nematode densities\rin soil at transplantation ranged from 1 to 53 J2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) of\rsoil in 2017 and did not differ between grafted and ungrafted\rwatermelons. At the end of the crop, the galling index and the number of\reggs per plant was higher in ungrafted than in grafted watermelon both\ryears. The C. amarus accessions performed from highly resistant to\rresistant to M. incognita, and the rootstock cv. Robusta from\rmoderately resistant in 2017 to slightly resistant in 2018. The repeated\rcultivation of grafted watermelon onto C. amarus accessions did not\rselect for virulence. All grafted watermelons yielded more kg per plant\rthan the ungrafted in both years. The results of this study highlight\rthe poorer host status of CI64 and CI67 accessions to M. incognita and\rM. javanica compared to watermelon; the stability of the C. amarus\rresistance; and the beneficial effect of C. amarus on watermelon yield\rwhen cultivated in Meloidogyne infested soils.\n2\nIntroduction\rGrafting vegetables onto resistant rootstocks for managing soilborne\rplant pathogens has become a common environmentally friendly alternative\rto soil fumigants (Judy A. Thies, Buckner, et al. 2015). Watermelon, the most cultivated\rcucurbit crop worldwide (FAOSTAT 2017)), is commonly grafted onto\rCucurbita maxima \\(\\times\\) Cucurbita moschata and Lagenaria\rsiceraria rootstocks to control fusarium wilt (Miguel et al. 2004)), but\rthese rootstocks are susceptible to root-knot nematodes (RKN),\rMeloidogyne spp. (Huitrón et al. 2007); (López-Gómez, Talavera, and Verdejo-Lucas 2016); (Levi et al. 2017).\rDespite RKN are the main plant parasitic nematode affecting cucurbit\rcrops (Hallmann and Meressa 2018)), watermelon is less affected than others, such\ras cucumber or melon (Giné et al. 2014); (Expósito et al. 2019)), due to its poor\rhost status (López-Gómez et al. 2014). Nonetheless, grafting onto\rinterspecific squash hybrid rootstocks leads to increasing nematode\rdensities (Giné et al. 2017)) making necessary the use of other methods for\rRKN management. Then, screening for other putative watermelon rootstocks\rresistant to both fusarium wilt and RKN, including Citrullus amarus,\rhas been done (Thies and Levi 2003), (2007); (Huitrón et al. 2007);\r(Thies et al. 2010), (2015)a, (2015), (2016);\r(Keinath et al. 2019). As a result of these studies, the C. amarus cv.\rCarolina Strongback has been jointly released by USDA-ARS and Clemson\rUniversity (Kemble et al. 2019). Recently, Helio A. García-Mendívil et al. (2019)\r((2019)) have reported two C. amarus accessions\rresistant to fusarium wilt that were also resistant to isolates of the\rthree most widespread RKN species, M. arenaria, M. incognita and M.\rjavanica, and were compatible as rootstocks for a watermelon cultivar.\rNonetheless, a wider characterization of the potential of these plant\rgermplasms for RKN management should consider the plant host status and\rthe level of plant resistance, and also the plant tolerance to estimate\ryield losses. The host status of a plant is determined by three\rparameters estimated with the relationship between the nematode density\rat transplanting (Pi) and at the end of the crop (Pf): the maximum\rmultiplication rate (a), the maximum population density (M), and the\requilibrium density (E, Pf = Pi; \\(Pf/Pi = 1\\)), that are higher in\rgood host than in resistant or poor host plants (Seinhorst 1970). The\rresistance level of a given plant can be categorized according to the\rreproduction index of the nematode, defined as the proportion of the\rnematode reproduction in a given germplasm compared to that in a\rsusceptible standard (Hadisoeganda 1982). Plant tolerance (T), the\rmaximum Pi at which no yield loss is recorded, is estimated by the\rrelationship between increasing Pi and the relative plant biomass or\rcrop yield. This parameter, along with the minimum relative yield (m),\rcan be estimated by the Seinhorst’s damage function model\r(Seinhorst 1998). In addition to this characterization, the knowledge\rof the risk of selection of virulent nematode populations can aid for\rdesigning good plant resistance management practices for preserving its\rdurability. Then, several experiments were conducted to estimate the\rpopulation dynamics of M. incognita and M. javanica on ungrafted and\rgrafted watermelon onto two C. amarus accessions, its level of\rresistance and tolerance, and the effect of cultivation two consecutive\rwatermelon crops in the same plots under plastic greenhouse conditions\ron M. incognita densities, selection for nematode virulence, and\rwatermelon yield.\n\rMaterials and methods\rNematode inoculum\rThe isolates Agropolis of M. incognita and MJ05 of M. javanica were\rused in the experiments. Both RKN isolates were maintained on the\rsusceptible tomato cv. Durinta (Seminis Seeds, St. Louis, Missouri). The\rnematode inoculum consisted in second-stage juveniles (J2) obtained from\reggs by blender maceration of infected roots in a 5% commercial bleach\rsolution (40 g/L NaOCl) for 10 min according to the Hussey and Barker\r((1973)) method. Afterwards, the egg suspension was\rfirstly filtered through a 74 \\(\\mu\\)m sieve and finally collected on a 25\r\\(\\mu\\)m sieve and placed on Baermann trays (Whitehead and Hemming 1965). The J2\remerged during the first 24 h were discarded. After that, the J2 emerged\rwere recovered every two days and maintained at 9 C for 8 days until the\rpot experiments were carried out. The identification of the\rMeloidogyne species was confirmed using SCAR-PCR markers\r(Zijlstra, Donkers-Venne, and Fargette 2000))\n\rRelationship between increasing Pi of M. incognita or M. javanica on ungrafted and grafted watermelon and Pf and plant biomass\rThe C. amarus accessions BGV0005164 (CI64) and BGV0005167 (CI67),\rprovided by Dr. Gisbert and Dr. Picó from the Institute for the\rConservation and Breeding of Agricultural Biodiversity gene bank\rcollection (COMAV-UPV, Valencia, Spain), and the watermelon cv. Sugar\rBaby (SB) (Intersemillas S. A., Loriguilla, Valencia, Spain) were used\rin the experiments. The watermelon cultivar SB was grafted onto the C.\ramarus accessions using the cleft procedure (Lee et al. 2010).\nThe watermelon SB ungrafted and grafted onto the C. amarus accessions\rwere transplanted into 3 L pots filled with sterile sand, and inoculated\rwith the M. incognita isolate Agropolis or M. javanica isolate MJ05\rat initial population densities (Pi) of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.5, 3,\r6 and 12 J2 per cm\\(^{3}\\) of sand to assess the relationship between Pi\rand the nematode densities at the end of the experiment (Pf), and the\reffect on relative dry shoot biomass. Each treatment was replicated four\rtimes. Plants were maintained from May to July (73 d) in a greenhouse.\rPlants were watered as needed and fertilized with a slow release\rfertilizer (15% N, 9% P\\(_{2}\\)O\\(_{5}\\), 12% K\\(_{2}\\)O, 2% MgO\\(_{2}\\),\rmicroelements; Osmocote Plus). Soil temperatures were recorded daily at\r30 min intervals with 5TM probes (Decagon devices, Inc.).\nAt the end of the experiment, plants were removed from the pots. The\raboveground part of the plants was dried in an oven at 70 C for 4 days\rand weighed. The roots were carefully washed free of soil and weighed.\rAfterwards, eggs were extracted by blender maceration of all the root\rsystem in a 10% commercial bleach solution (40 g/L NaOCl)\r(Hussey and Barker 1973)) and was considered the Pf. The maximum\rmultiplication rate (a) was estimated by the slope of the linear\rregression between Pf and the lowest values of Pi, according to Pf\r= aPi (Seinhorst 1970). The maximum population density (M) was\restimated from the experimental data, and the equilibrium density (E)\rwas estimated by iteration from the regression equation obtained from\rthe relation between Pi and Pf.\n\rEffect of C. amarus on M. incognita reproduction, disease severity and watermelon yield cultivated in plastic greenhouse\rThe experiment was conducted in a 700 m\\(^{2}\\) plastic greenhouse located\rat Viladecans (Barcelona, Spain), infested with M. incognita. The soil\rtexture was sandy loam with 83.8% sand, 6.7% loam and 9.5% clay; pH 8.7;\r1.8% of organic matter (w/w) and 0.5 dS/m electrical conductivity. The\rexperiment consisted in four treatments: SB grafted onto CI64; SB\rgrafted onto CI67, SB grafted onto the C. lanatus rootstock cv.\rRobusta (RO) (Intersemillas S. A., Loriguilla, Valencia, Spain), and the\rungrafted SB. Each treatment was replicated 5 times in plots with narrow\rvariation on nematode densities between treatments at transplantation of\rthe first crop in 2017. Crops were carried out from April 10 to August\r17 2017 (129 d) and from March 20 to August 7 2018 (140 d). Plots were\rmaintained in black fallow between cropping seasons. Individual plots\rconsisted in a row with 4 plants spaced 0.6 cm. Plots within a row were\rspaced 1 m. Plants of each treatment were cultivated in the same plot\reach year to determine the effect on M. incognita densities, the\rdisease severity, the crop yield and the durability of the resistance.\rSoil of each plot was prepared individually to avoid cross\rcontamination. Plants were irrigated as needed trough a drip irrigation\rsystem and fertilized with a solution of NPK (15-5-30) at 31 kg/ha, iron\rchelate and micronutrients at 0.9 kg/ha. Weeds were removed manually\rbefore and during the cropping season. Fruit yield were determined 13\rand 18 weeks after transplanting the crop in 2017, and at 15 and 20\rweeks after transplanting in 2018. Soil temperatures and water content\rof soil were recorded daily at 1 h intervals with digital probes 5TM\r(Decagon devices, Inc.) placed at 15 cm depth.\nNematode densities in soil were determined at transplantation (Pi) and\rat the end of the crop (Pf). Soil samples were taken from each\rexperimental plot and consisted of eight cores taken from the first 30\rcm of soil with an auger of diameter 2.5 cm. Soil subsamples were mixed\rand passed through a 4 mm pore sieve to remove stones. The J2 were\rextracted from 500 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil using Baermann trays\r(Whitehead and Hemming 1965)) and incubated at 27 \\(\\pm\\) 2 C for one week. J2 were\rcollected using a 25 \\(\\mu\\)m aperture screen, counted, and expressed as\rJ2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil. At the end of the crop, roots were\rcarefully uprooted and washed, and the galling index (GI) was evaluated\ron a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = complete and healthy root system and\r10 = plants and roots dead (Zeck 1971). After that, the number of\reggs per plant were determined extracting them from roots by blender\rmaceration in a 5% commercial bleach solution (40 g/L NaOCl)\r(Hussey and Barker 1973)), as previously stated. The eggs extracted\rfrom roots of SB, CI67, and RO at the end of the crop in 2018 were\rincubated in Baermann trays at 27 \\(\\pm\\) 2 C to allow J2 emergence to\rdetermine the putative selection for virulence. Reproduction index (RI)\rwas calculated as the percentage of eggs produced in the rootstock with\rregard to that in the watermelon cultivar. The response of the rootstock\rwas categorized according to the RI as highly resistant (RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 1%),\rresistant (1% \\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 10%), moderately resistant (10% \\(\\leq\\) RI\r\\(\u0026lt;\\) 25%), slightly resistant (25% \\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 50%), or susceptible (RI\r\\(\\geq\\) 50%) (Hadisoeganda 1982).\n\rVirulence selection\rThe nematode inoculum consisted of J2 obtained as previously described.\rThe J2 emerged in the first 24 h were discarded. Afterwards, nematodes\rwere collected daily for 10 days using a 25 \\(\\mu\\)m sieve and stored at 9\rC until inoculation. Seeds of SB, CI67, and RO were germinated according\rto the method given in Expósito et al. ((2018). Seedlings\rwere transplanted to 200 cm\\(^{3}\\) pots containing sterile sand and\rmaintained in a growth chamber at 25 \\(\\pm\\) 2 C with a 16:8 h\r(light:dark) photoperiod for a week, and then inoculated with 1 J2 per\rcm\\(^{3}\\) sand. Each treatment was replicated 7 times. Plants were\rmaintained in the growth chamber for 50 days. Plants were watered as\rneeded throughout the experiment and fertilized with a slow-release\rfertilizer (15% N, 9% P\\(_{2}\\)O\\(_{5}\\), 12% K\\(_{2}\\)O, 2% MgO\\(_{2}\\),\rmicroelements; Osmocote Plus). Soil temperatures were recorded daily at\r30 min intervals with PT100 probes (Campbell Scientific Ltd.).\nAt the end of the experiments, the roots were carefully washed free of\rsand. Afterwards, the GI was evaluated, the number of eggs per plant was\rdetermined, the RI was calculated, and the level of resistance was\rcategorized following the procedures previously stated.\n\rStatistical analysis\rStatistical analyses were performed using R Statistical software version\r3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The\rdata were not normally distributed according to the normal Shapiro–Wilk\rW test. Then, the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test was used for\rpaired comparisons. The relative yield of grafted or ungrafted\rwatermelon was plotted against the Pi values and submitted to a\rnon-linear regression analysis (proc nlin) of SAS system V9.4 (SAS\rInstitute Inc., Cary, NC) to determine if they fitted the Seinhorst\rdamage function model \\(y = m + (1 - m) 0.95 ^{Pi / (T - 1)}\\) when Pi\r\\(\\geq\\) T, and \\(y = 1\\) when Pi \\(\u0026lt;\\) T, where y is the relative\ryield, m is the minimum relative yield, and T is the tolerance limit\r(Seinhorst 1998).\n\r\rResults\rRelationship between increasing Pi of M. incognita or M. javanica on ungrafted and grafted watermelon and Pf and plant biomass\rThe sand temperature during the experiment ranged from 20.6 C to 30.6 C.\rThe maximum multiplication rate (a), the maximum population density\r(M), and the equilibrium density (E) of the M. incognita isolate\rAgropolis in CI64 and CI67 were 37% and 29%, 72% and 76%, and 69% and\r79% lower than in SB, respectively. Regarding the M. javanica isolate\rMJ05, the values of a, M and E in CI64 and CI67 were 99% and 81%,\r65% and 76%, and 15% and 33% lower than in SB, respectively (Table\r2.1,\rfig. \\[fig:Figure301\\]). The relationship between Pi and the dry\rshoot biomass of the ungrafted and grafted watermelon did not fit the\rSeinhorst’s damage model irrespective of the nematode isolate (data not\rshown).\n\rEffect of C. amarus on M. incognita reproduction, disease severity and watermelon yield cultivated in plastic greenhouse\rThe minimum and maximum soil temperatures during the cropping season in\r2017 ranged from 13.1 C to 29.8 C, and from 13.5 C to 29.3 C in 2018.\rThe nematode densities in soil at transplantation ranged from 1 to 53 J2\rper 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil in 2017 and did not differ (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05)\rbetween grafted and ungrafted watermelons, but the galling index (fig.\r2.2)\rand the number of eggs per plant differed (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05) between grafted\rand ungrafted watermelons at the end of the crop (Table\r\\[tab:table302\\]). All grafted watermelons yielded between 2.9\rand 5.6 more kg per plant (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05) than the ungrafted SB. In 2018,\rnematode densities in soil did not differ (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05) between grafted\rand ungrafted watermelons either at transplantation nor at the end of\rthe crop, nonetheless higher galling index (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05) and more eggs\rper plant (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05) were registered in ungrafted than grafted SB.\rRegarding crop yield, grafted watermelons yielded between 2.0 and 2.7\rmore kg per plant (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05) than the ungrafted SB. The C. amarus\raccessions performed from highly resistant to resistant (1% \\(\\leq\\) RI\r\\(\u0026lt;\\) 10%) to M. incognita in both years, and the rootstock RO from\rmoderately resistant (10% \\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 25%) in 2017, to slightly\rresistant (25% \\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 50%) in 2018 (Table 2).\n\rVirulence selection\rAll the M. incognita subpopulations infected all the plant germplasm\r(GI \\(\u0026gt;\\) 1) but none of them reproduced in CI67 and reproduced less (P\r\\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05) in RO than SB (Table\r\\[tab:table303\\]).

García-Mendívil et al. 2019)),\rbut no information on its response to increasing nematode densities has\rbeen previously published. The results of this study show the poorest\rhost status of both C. amarus accessions irrespective of the\rMeloidogyne species. The nematode population dynamic parameters in the\rC. amarus accessions were lower than in watermelon, which has been\rreported as a poor host of M. javanica compared to other cucurbits in\rexperiments conducted under the same conditions (Giné et al. 2014);\r(López-Gómez et al. 2014), (2015). The maximum multiplication\rrate of M. javanica in watermelon was 96.7% and 98.3% lower than in\rzucchini and cucumber, respectively; and the equilibrium density,\rconsidered as an indicator of plant tolerance, was 93% lower than in\rzucchini but 494 times higher than in cucumber. In relation to M.\rincognita, as far we know, there is no information on these population\rdynamic parameters for watermelon. Interestingly, the results of this\rstudy show that watermelon and both C. amarus accessions are less\rsuitable hosts for M. incognita than for M. javanica according to\rthe lower values of maximum multiplication rate and maximum population\rdensity. However, watermelon, conversely to both C. amarus accessions,\rwould tolerate better M. incognita than M. javanica according to the\rE values. In our experiments, the C. amarus accessions along with\rthe watermelon cultivar tolerates both M. incognita and M. javanica\rsince no differences in dry top weight biomass were found when submitted\rto Pi levels from 0 to 1200 J2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil. Lopez-Gomez\ret al. ((2016)) also did not find any differences at Pi\rlevels from 0 to 1000 J2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil in pot experiments,\rbut they did at Pi levels from 0 to 51200 J2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil\r(López-Gómez et al. 2014).\nThe resistance level of both C. amarus accessions was maintained after\rbeing cultivated for two consecutive growing seasons in the same plots\runder plastic greenhouse conditions. In addition, no selection for\rvirulence to C. amarus was found according to the results of the\rexperiment conducted with the nematode subpopulations obtained from\rroots of each germplasm at the end of the second crop. These results are\rin agreement with that reported by Thies et al. ((2010)) who\rfound that the resistance of some C. amarus assessed in field\rconditions was maintained after two consecutive years of cultivation.\rThe resistance of C. amarus to RKN has been associated with the root\rfibrosity (Thies and Levi 2003), (2007); (Judy A. Thies, Levi, et al. 2015), (2016).\rIn this study, the level of root fibrosity was not assessed but visual\rcomparison between the root systems of all the assessed germplasms\rsuggest that those of the C. amarus accessions were more fibrous than\rthat of watermelon, as has been shown in fig.\r\\[tab:table302\\]. In fact, Thies et al., ((2010))\rproposed the assessment of the percentage of fibrous roots as an\radditional trait for identifying RKN resistance in C. amarus.\nRegarding watermelon yield, grafting increased between 2 and 5.6 kg per\rplant compared to the ungrafted watermelon. Previous studies reported\rthat grafting watermelon onto C. amarus lines yielded between 1.3 and\r1.9 more times than the non-grafted cultivated in heavily infested soils\r(Judy A. Thies, Ariss, et al. 2015), (2015)b, (2015)c), and also when grafted\ronto cv. Carolina Strongback and cultivated in soils infested with\rFusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (Fon) race 2 and M. incognita but\rnot in soils infested with M. incognita alone (Keinath et al. 2019).\nAmong the C. amarus accessions assessed in this study, the CI67 has\rbeen shown compatible with watermelon without affecting fruit quality\r(Fredes et al. 2017); (Helio A. García-Mendívil et al. 2019). Then, this accession might be\ran effective alternative to other watermelon rootstocks. In addition, it\rmight be an additional resistant genetic source to be included in\rrotation schemes for managing the most widespread tropical Meloidogyne\rspecies, and could affect the level of virulence for a given R-gene if\rselection occurs as reported by Expósito et al. ((2019))\rincluding Cucumis metuliferus in the rotation schema. In addition, the\rreduced ability of the nematode to reproduce in CI67 could leave low\rnematode densities at transplantation of the following crop, which will\rsuffer less damage and crop yield losses (Ornat, Verdejo-Lucas, and Sorribas 1997);\r(Talavera et al. 2009); (Giné et al. 2017); (Expósito et al. 2019).\n\rConclusion\rThe results of this study highlight the poorest host status of the CI64\rand CI67 accessions to M. incognita and M. javanica; its tolerance\rto both Meloidogyne species; the stability of the resistance; and its\rproductivity when cropped in infested soils.\n\rAcknowledgments\rThe authors thank MINECO and FEDER for funding projects\rAGL2013-49040-C2-1-R and AGL2017-89785-R, and CONACYT for providing PhD\rfunding to H.

The response of S.\rtorvum rootstock cultivars Brutus, Espina, Salutamu and Torpedo against\rM. incognita and Mi1.2 (a)virulent M. javanica isolates was\rdetermined in pot experiments, and of ‘Brutus’ to an N-virulent\risolate of M. incognita, compared with that of the eggplant S.\rmelongena ‘Cristal’. The relationship between the initial and final\rpopulation densities of M. javanica on ungrafted and grafted ‘Cristal’\ronto the S. torvum ‘Brutus’ was assessed, together with the effect on\rdry shoot biomass. finally, the population growth rate and the\rresistance level of the four S. torvum cultivars against M.\rincognita was assessed under plastic greenhouse conditions in two\rcropping seasons. All S. torvum rootstocks responded as resistant to\rthe M. incognita isolates and from highly resistant to susceptible\ragainst M. javanica isolates. The maximum multiplication rates of M.\rjavanica on the ungrafted or grafted eggplant were 270 and 49,\rrespectively, and the equilibrium densities were 1318 and 2056 eggs and\rJ2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) soil, respectively. The tolerance of the ungrafted\reggplant was 10.9 J2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) soil, and the minimum relative dry\rshoot biomass was 0.76. The population growth rate of M. incognita on\reggplant cv. Cristal differed from that of the S. torvum cultivars in\rboth cropping seasons. These results suggest that S. torvum is a\rvaluable rootstock for managing the two Meloidogyne species\rirrespective of the (a)virulence status.\n2\nIntroduction\rRoot knot nematodes (RKN), Meloidogyne spp., are the most damaging\rplant-parasitic nematodes worldwide. This genus comprises more than 100\rspecies, but four of them are responsible for the majority of crop yield\rlosses: the tropical species M. arenaria, M. incognita and M.\rjavanica, and the temperate species M. hapla (Jones et al. 2013). RKN can\rcause severe damage in solanaceous crops, depending on the plant\rgermplasm, the nematode soil density at transplanting, the (a)virulence\rstatus of the population, and the environmental conditions. Estimations\rof yield losses caused by RKN in several crops have been summarized\r(Greco and Di Vito 2009). Regarding fruiting solanaceous crops, maximum yield\rlosses of 94, 95 and 100% have been reported for pepper (Capsicum\rannuum), eggplant (Solanum melongena), and tomato (S. lycopersicum)\rin microplot experiments, respectively. Although RKN control has broadly\rbeen done using soil fumigants and nonfumigant nematicides, current\rregulations, including the European Directive 2009/128/EC and the US\rClean Air Act (US Environmental Protection Agency, 2012), are\rencouraging the research and development of environment-friendly\ralternative management strategies. The use of plant resistance is an\reffective and economically profitable approach for RKN management\r(Sorribas et al. 2005). The commercial RKN resistant-tolerant germplasm\rreduces both the infectivity and reproduction of the nematode, and\rreduces crop yield losses (Talavera et al. 2009); (Giné and Sorribas 2017);\r(Expósito et al. 2019). RKN resistant germplasm comprises both cultivars\rand rootstocks. Grafting is a useful option when no commercial RKN\rresistant cultivars are available or when other resistance/tolerance\rgenes are needed for complementing the management of other economically\rimportant soilborne diseases and/or abiotic stresses but have not been\rintrogressed into commercial cultivars (Kumar, Bharti, and Saravaiya 2018). Despite these\radvantages, plant resistance must be used properly to avoid selection\rfor virulence by the repeated cultivation of plant germplasm carrying\rthe same resistance (R) gene (Verdejo-Lucas et al. 2009); (Giné and Sorribas 2017)); and\ralso to reduce the expression of plant resistance due to high soil\rtemperatures (Araujo et al. 1982).\nEggplant is one of the most cultivated solanaceous crops with an\restimated worldwide production of c. 52 million tonnes in 1.8 million\rha (FAOSTAT 2017). This plant species is affected by some soilborne\rpathogens including RKN. To control them, eggplant has been mostly\rgrafted onto resistant tomato or tomato interspecific hybrids (S.\rlycopersicum \\(\\times\\) S. habrochaites) (Daunay 2008). However, the\rcontinuous use of tomato rootstocks induces the selection for virulence\r(Verdejo-Lucas et al. 2009); (Expósito et al. 2019). Consequently, other\rresistant germplasms have been assessed, including S. melongena lines,\rinterspecific hybrids of S. integrifolium \\(\\times\\) S. melongena,and\rwild related species such as S. integrifolium, S. sisymbriifolium\rand S. torvum (Daunay 2008). Among these wild species, only S.\rtorvum is currently commercially available to be employed as a\rrootstock for eggplant cultivation worldwide (Uehara, Tateishi, et al. 2017);\r(Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018).\nSome S. torvum cultivars are resistant to a wide range of soilborne\rdiseases, including fungal and bacterial wilt diseases (Daunay 2008).\rRegarding RKN, S. torvum accessions and cultivars have been\rconsistently described as resistant to M. incognita (Ali et al. 1992);\r(Rahman et al. 2002); (Dhivya, Sadasakthi, and Sivakumar 2014)), M. luci ( (Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018)), and some\rpopulations of M. arenaria and M. javanica (Tzortzakakis, Bletsos, and Avgelis 2006);\r(Uehara, Tateishi, et al. 2017); (Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018)); but are described as susceptible to M.\rhapla ( (Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018). As far as the authors know, there is no\rinformation about the performance of commercial S. torvum cultivars\ragainst M. incognita and M. javanica populations from Spain, the\rmost frequent RKN species in vegetable growing areas. Some are known to\rbe virulent to the Mi1.2 or the N genes in tomato and pepper,\rrespectively (Ornat, Verdejo-Lucas, and Sorribas 2001); (Robertson et al. 2006); (Verdejo-Lucas, Talavera, and Andrés 2012).\nThe design of effective and profitable management strategies must\rconsider the host status, the resistance level and the tolerance of the\rplant species and germplasm to RKN species and local populations. The\rhost status is estimated by three parameters obtained from the\rrelationship between the nematode population density at transplanting\r(initial population density, Pi) and at the end of the crop (final\rpopulation density, Pf): (i) the maximum multiplication rate in the\rabsence of limiting factors (a); (ii) the maximum population density\rachieved by the nematode under specific conditions (M); and (iii) the\requilibrium density at which the plant can supply enough nutrients to a\rgiven Pi to maintain this density at the end of the crop (E, Pf =\rPi; Pf/Pi = 1) (Seinhorst 1970). The values of these parameters\rare higher in susceptible than in resistant or poor hosts. Another\ruseful indicator is the population growth rate, estimated by the\rrelationship between the Pi and the multiplication rate (Pf/Pi),\rwhich allows comparison of nematode population dynamics between plant\rspecies or germplasms, as well as the efficacy of control methods\r(Talavera et al. 2009); (Giné and Sorribas 2017); (Expósito et al. 2019). The resistance\rlevel of a given plant germplasm is categorized according to the\rreproduction index (RI), expressed as the percentage of RKN reproduction\rin a plant germplasm with regard to that in a susceptible standard plant\rhost (Hadisoeganda 1982). Plant tolerance (T), the maximum Pi at\rwhich no yield losses is recorded, is estimated by the relationship\rbetween increasing Pi and the relative plant biomass or crop yield.\rThis parameter, along with the minimum relative yield (m), can be\restimated by the Seinhorst’s damage function model (Seinhorst 1998).\rThus, several experiments were conducted to characterize the host\rsuitability of four commercial S. torvum rootstocks against several\rM. incognita and M. javanica isolates, including virulent isolates\rto the Mi1.2 or N genes; to estimate the population dynamic of M.\rjavanica on ungrafted and grafted eggplant onto S. torvum ‘Brutus’\rand also the plant tolerance and the minimum relative dry shoot biomass;\rand to determine the effect of increasing Pi and cropping season on\rthe M. incognita population growth rate and the level of resistance.\n\rMaterials and methods\rPlant material\rThe four S. torvum rootstocks cultivars Brutus (TB), Espina (TE),\rSalutamu (TS) and Torpedo (TT), and the eggplant cv. Cristal (MC) were\rused in the experiments. The main characteristics of these cultivars are\rpresented in Table 3.1. Seeds of the S. torvum cultivars were\rpretreated with a KNO\\(_{3}\\) solution to improve germination\r(Ranil et al. 2015). Afterwards, seeds were transferred to\rvermiculite-filled trays and incubated in a growth chamber at 25 \\(\\pm\\) 2\rC and a 16:8 h light:dark photoperiod for 4 weeks. Seedlings were\rtransplanted singly to pots containing sterilized river sand.\n\rNematode inoculum\rSix M. incognita and eight M. javanica isolates were used in the\rexperiments (Table 3.2). All RKN isolates were maintained on the\rsusceptible tomato cv. Durinta (Seminis Seeds). The M. javanica MJLg\rand M. incognita MILgN field isolates were provided by M. López-Gómez\r(Rijk Zwaan Iberica). These isolates were obtained from fields in which\rresistant tomato or pepper cultivars were the main crops, and in which a\rpossible selection for virulence might have occurred. Virulence status\rof the MJLg isolate to the Mi1.2 gene in tomato, and of the MILgN\risolate to the N gene in pepper was confirmed 55 days after\rcultivation of the resistant tomato cv. Monika and the susceptible cv.\rDurinta, and the resistant pepper cv. Solfeo and the susceptible cv.\rCompás in 200 cm\\(^{3}\\) pots inoculated with 1 second-juvenile\r(J2)/cm\\(^{3}\\) of sand and maintained in a growth chamber at 25 \\(\\pm\\) 2\rC. The number of eggs produced by the MJLg and MILgN isolates in the\rresistant tomato and pepper were a 98.3% and 89.3% of those produced in\rthe susceptible tomato and pepper cultivars, respectively (Table\r3.3,\rResults section). All the Meloidogyne isolates were identified by\rSCAR-PCR markers (Zijlstra, Donkers-Venne, and Fargette 2000))\nThe inoculum used in the pot experiments consisted in J2 emerged from\reggs extracted from infected roots by maceration of roots using a 5%\rcommercial bleach solution (40 g/L NaOCl) during 10 min\r(Hussey and Barker 1973). The J2 emerged during the first 24 h were\rdiscarded. After that, J2 were recovered every two days and maintained\rat 9C for 8 days until the pot experiments were carried out.\n\rHost suitability\rThree pot experiments were carried out to evaluate the response of the\rfour S. torvum rootstocks against Meloidogyne spp. In the first\rexperiment, the response of the S. torvum rootstocks was assessed\ragainst five avirulent isolates of M. incognita and six of M.\rjavanica. Plants were transplanted to 1 L pots and maintained in a\rgreenhouse for 40 days. In the second experiment, the S. torvum\rrootstocks were assessed against the M. javanica Mi1.2-virulent\risolate MJLg in 200 cm\\(^{3}\\) pots and maintained in a growth chamber at\r25 \\(\\pm\\) 2 C with a 16:8h (light:dark) photoperiod for 55 days. In the\rthird experiment, the response of the selected S. torvum rootstock TB\rwas assessed against the M. javanica Mi1.2-virulent isolate MJ27 and\rthe N-virulent M. incognita isolate MILgN in 500 cm\\(^{3}\\) pots and\rmaintained for 49 days in a greenhouse. The rootstock cv. Brutus was\rselected because showed the most stable response against the most RKN\risolates assessed. The eggplant MC was included in all experiment as\rsusceptible control for comparison. Each plant–RKN isolate combination\rwas replicated seven times and the experiments conducted twice, with two\rweeks apart between each repetition.\nAll experiments were conducted following the same procedure. Plants were\rinoculated with 1 J2/cm\\(^{3}\\) of sand. Plants were watered as needed\rthroughout the experiment and fertilized with a slow release fertilizer\r(15% N, 9% P\\(_{2}\\)O\\(_{5}\\), 12% K\\(_{2}\\)O, 2% MgO\\(_{2}\\), microelements;\rOsmocote Plus). Soil temperatures were recorded daily at 30 min\rintervals with PT100 probes (Campbell Scientific Ltd.).\nAt the end of the experiments, roots were carefully removed from the\rsoil and washed. The final population density (Pf) was determined\rextracting the eggs by maceration of roots in a 10% commercial bleach\rsolution (40 g/L NaOCl) for 10 min (Hussey and Barker 1973)) and final\rcounting. Reproduction index (RI) was calculated as the percentage of\reggs produced in the rootstock cultivar with regard to that in the\reggplant cultivar. The response of the plant host was categorized\raccording to the RI as highly resistant (RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 1%), resistant (1%\r\\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 10%), moderately resistant (10% \\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 25%),\rslightly resistant (25% \\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 50%) or susceptible (RI \\(\\geq\\)\r50%) (Hadisoeganda 1982).\n\rPopulation dynamics of M. javanica on ungrafted and grafted eggplant\rThe eggplant MC ungrafted and grafted onto the S. torvum rootstock cv.\rTB were transplanted into 500 cm\\(^{3}\\) pots filled with sterile sand,\rand inoculated with the M. javanica isolate MJ27 at 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4,\r0.8, 1.5, 3, 6 and 12 J2/cm\\(^{3}\\) of sand (initial population density,\rPi) to assess the relationship between Pi and Pf, and the effect\ron relative dry shoot biomass. Each treatment was replicated four times.\rPlants were maintained in a greenhouse for 55 days, from June to August,\r2017. Plants were watered as needed and fertilized with Osmocote Plus.\rSoil temperatures were also recorded daily at 30 min intervals with 5TM\rprobes.\nAt the end of the experiment, plants were uprooted, the roots were\rcarefully washed free of sand and weighed. The aboveground part of the\rplant (leaves, stems, flowers and fruits) were dried in an oven at 70 C\rfor 4 days and weighed. The Pf was determined as described previously.\rThe maximum multiplication rate (a) was estimated by the slope of the\rlinear regression between Pf and the lowest values of Pi, according\rto \\(Pf = aPi\\) (Seinhorst 1970). The maximum population density (M)\rwas estimated from the experimental data, and the equilibrium density\r(E) was estimated by iteration from the regression equation obtained\rfrom the relation between Pi and Pf.\n\rEffect of increasing Pi and seasonal cultivation on M. incognita\rTwo experiments were conducted in a 700 m\\(^{2}\\) plastic greenhouse\rlocated at Viladecans (Barcelona, Spain), infested with M. incognita.\rThe first experiment was conducted from May 10 to June 27, 2016 (48\rdays), and the second from October 4, 2016 to January 31, 2017 (119\rdays). The S. torvum rootstocks TB, TE, TS and TT, and the susceptible\reggplant MC were cultivated in 10 and 15 (2.5 m long) plots in the first\rand second experiments, respectively. In each single plot, one plant of\reach germplasm was transplanted with a space of 0.5 m, in such a way\rthat every germplasm was an equal number of times nearby to both the\redge of the plots and the susceptible MC. Plants were irrigated as\rneeded through a drip irrigation system, and weekly fertilized with a\rsolution consisting of NPK (15-5-30) at 31 kg/ha and iron chelate and\rmicronutrients at 0.9 kg/ha. The temperature was recorded at 30 min\rinterval with temperature probes 5TM (Decagon devices, Inc.) at a depth\rof 15 cm.\nNematode population density was determined at transplantation (Pi).\rSoil samples consisted of eight cores taken from the first 30 cm of soil\rwith an auger of diameter 2.5 cm. Soil subsamples were mixed and sieved\r(4 mm) to remove stones. For each experimental plot, J2 were extracted\rfrom 500 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil using Baermann trays (Whitehead and Hemming 1965)) and\rincubated at 27 \\(\\pm\\) 2 C for a week. J2 were counted and expressed as\rJ2 per 250 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil. At the end of the experiments, roots were\rcarefully removed from the soil, washed, and weighed, and the galling\rindex (GI) was estimated in a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = complete and\rhealthy root system and 10 = plants and roots dead (Zeck 1971). The\rPf was determined from all the root system, the RI was calculated and\rthe resistance level categorized as described previously. The maximum\rmultiplication rate (a) and the maximum population density (M) were\restimated as described previously, and the equilibrium density (E)\rfrom the linear regression equation obtained from the relationship\rbetween log\\(_{10}\\) Pi and log\\(_{10}\\) \\(Pf/Pi\\).\n\rStatistical analysis\rStatistical analysis was performed using R Statistical Software version\r3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The\rdata from the host suitability experiments were not normally distributed\raccording to the normal Shapiro–Wilk W test. Then, data were\rsubmitted to the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test to compare between\rrepetitions of the same experiment. When no differences were found (P\r\\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05), data were pooled and considered as replications of the same\rexperiment. Comparisons between plant germplasm per each RKN isolate as\rwell as between RKN isolates per each plant germplasm within each\rexperiment were done by the Mann–Whitney U test (two groups) or the\rKruskal–Wallis non parametric test (more than two groups). When\rsignificant (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05), medians were subsequently separated using\rpairwise multiple comparisons by the Dunn test (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05). The\rnonlinear procedure (proc nlin) of SAS system V9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.,\rCary, NC) was used to determine the compliance of the data to the\rSeinhorst damage function model (Seinhorst 1998));\r\\(y = m + (1 - m) 0.95 ^{Pi / (T - 1)}\\) when Pi \\(\\geq\\) T, and \\(y = 1\\)\rwhen Pi \\(\u0026lt;\\) T, where y is the relative dry shoot biomass, m is\rthe minimum relative dry shoot biomass, and T is the tolerance limit.\rThe values of Pi and Pf/Pi were transformed to log\\(_{10}\\) to\rlinearize the relationship between Pi and Pi/Pf and the regression\rof each rootstock cultivar was compared to that of the eggplant MC. When\rthe Pi values of different experimental plots per seasonal cultivation\rwere closer the mean was calculated (Schomaker and Been 2013)) and used for the\rregression analysis between Pi and Pf/Pi.\n\r\rResults\rHost suitability\rThe minimal, maximal and mean sand temperatures recorded in the\rgreenhouse conditions experiments were 23.3C, 30.0 C and 27.4 C,\rrespectively, in experiment 1; and 17.8 C, 25.6C and 22.8 C in\rexperiment 3. All RKN isolates produced less (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05) number of\reggs in the S. torvum rootstocks cultivars than in the eggplant cv.\rMC, irrespective of the nematode species and virulence status. The\rresponse of all S. torvum rootstocks ranged between highly resistant\r(RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 1%) (3 out of 21 combinations) and resistant (10% \\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\)\r10%) (18 out of 21 combinations) to the M. incognita isolates. But\rthey responded mainly as resistant and moderately resistant (15 and 10\rout 29 combinations, respectively) to the M. javanica isolates (Table\r\\[tab:Table404\\]).\n\rPopulation dynamics of M. javanica on ungrafted and grafted eggplant\rThe minimum, maximum and mean sand temperatures recorded were 23.9, 27.8\rand 26.2 C, respectively. The maximum multiplication rate (a), maximum\rdensity (M) and equilibrium density (E) of the M. javanica isolate\rMJ27 on the ungrafted eggplant MC were 270, 30 906 eggs+J2 per 100\rcm\\(^{3}\\), and 1318 eggs+J2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\), respectively. In the\rgrafted MC onto TB the values of a, M and E were 49, 4223 eggs+J2\rper 100 cm\\(^{3}\\), and 2056 eggs+J2 per cm\\(^{3}\\), respectively (fig.\r\\[fig:Figure401\\]). The relationship between Pi and dry shoot\rweight biomass for the ungrafted eggplant fitted to the Seinhorst damage\rmodel (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.0001, R\\(^{2}\\) = 0.998), but that of the grafted\reggplant did not. The tolerance (T) of the ungrafted eggplant was 10.9\rJ2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) soil, and the minimum dry shoot biomass (m) was\r0.76 (fig. \\[fig:Figure402\\]).\n\rEffect of increasing Pi and seasonal cultivation on M. incognita\rThe Pi in the 10 experimental plots cultivated in spring–summer\rranged from 10 to 547 J2 per 250 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil, and the minimum,\rmaximum and mean soil temperatures were 17.5, 28.2 and 23.5 C,\rrespectively. The Pi in the 15 experimental plots cultivated in\rautumn–winter ranged from 42 to 842 per 250 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil, and the\rminimum, maximum and mean soil temperatures were 6.8, 25.5 and 16.4 C,\rrespectively. The S. torvum rootstocks showed a lower (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05)\rgalling index than the susceptible MC eggplant, with fewer (P \\(\u0026lt;\\)\r0.05) eggs per plant, irrespective of the cropping season. The\rresistance level of the S. torvum rootstocks shifted from highly\rresistant or resistant in the spring–summer crop to moderately\rresistant in the autumn–winter crop. The maximum multiplication rate\r(a), maximum density (M) and equilibrium density (E) of M.\rincognita were higher on the susceptible MC than on the S. torvum\rrootstocks, irrespective of the cropping season (Table\r\\[tab:Table405\\]). The population growth rate of M. incognita\rin the MC differed from those in all the S. torvum rootstocks in the\rspring–summer crop (fig.\r\\[fig:Figure403\\]a) (MC \\(vs\\) TB: intercept P = 0.0009, slope\rP = 0.5829; MC \\(vs\\) TE: intercept P = 0.0095, slope P = 0.9909; MC\r\\(vs\\) TS: intercept P = 0.0009, slope P = 0.3637; MC \\(vs\\) TT:\rintercept P = 0.0018, slope P = 0.8036), but only differed from some\rof them when cultivated in autumn–winter (fig.\r\\[fig:Figure403\\]b) (MC \\(vs\\) TB: intercept P = 0.0125, slope\rP = 0.0854; MC \\(vs\\) TE: intercept P = 0.0136, slope P = 0.1150; MC\r\\(vs\\) TS: intercept P = 0.0060, slope P = 0.0730; MC \\(vs\\) TT:\rintercept P = 0.4685, slope P = 0.9616).\n\rResistance and origin of Solanum melongena (eggplant) and the S.\rtorvum rootstock cultivars used in experiments.\r\rPlant host\rCultivar (code)\rResistance\rCompany\r\r\r\rS. melongena\rCristal (MC)\r\rSemillas fito\r\rS. torvum\rBrutus (TB)\rHR: Ma, Mi, Mj; IR: Va, Vd\rSemillas fito\r\r\rEspina (TB)\rHR: Fom; Rs, Pl, Ma, Mi, Mj, Vd\rAsasem\r\r\rSalutamu (TS)\rHR: N, Pl, Vd\rLa perla de sud\r\r\rTorpedo (TT)\rHR: Rs, V, Fol; IR: N\rRamiro Arnedo\r\r\r\r\raHR: high resistance; IR: intermediate resistance; Fom: Fusarium\roxysporum f. sp. melongena; Fol: Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.\rlycopersici; Ma: Meloidogyne arenaria; Mi: M. incognita; Mj: M.\rjavanica; N: Nematodes (Meloidogyne); Pl: Pyrenochaeta lycopersici;\rRs: Ralstonia solanacearum; V: Verticillium spp.; Va: Verticillium\ralboatrum Vd: Verticillium dahliae.\n\rMeloidogyne isolates from Spain, geographic origin, virulence\rstatus against tomato cultivars carrying the Mi1.2 of tomato or N\rof pepper.\r\rMeloidogyne spp.\rIsolate\rGeographic origin\r(a)Virulence\rReferece\r\r\r\rM. incognita\rMIAd\rBarcelona\rAvirulent\r-\r\r\rMIAm\rBarcelona\rAvirulent\r-\r\r\rMIAL09\rAlmeria\rAvirulent\r(Verdejo-Lucas, Talavera, and Andrés 2012)\r\r\rMIAL30\rAlmeria\rAvirulent\r(Verdejo-Lucas, Talavera, and Andrés 2012)\r\r\rMIPa\rAlmeria\rAvirulent\r-\r\r\rMILGN\rAlmeria\rN-virulent\r-\r\rM. javaniva\rMJ05\rBarcelona\rAvirulent\r(Ornat, Verdejo-Lucas, and Sorribas 2001)\r\r\rMJAL01\rAlmeria\rAvirulent\r(Verdejo-Lucas, Talavera, and Andrés 2012)\r\r\rMJAL05\rAlmeria\rAvirulent\r(Verdejo-Lucas, Talavera, and Andrés 2012)\r\r\rMJPm\rMurcia\rAvirulent\r-\r\r\rMJTU\rBarcelona\rAvirulent\r(Expósito et al. 2018)\r\r\rMJVI\rBarcelona\rAvirulent\r-\r\r\rMJ27\rBarcelona\rMi1.2-virulent\r(Ornat, Verdejo-Lucas, and Sorribas 2001)\r\r\rMJLg\rAlmeria\rMi1.2-virulent\r-\r\r\r\r\r\rNumber of eggs per plant and reproduction index (RI) of MJLg isolate\rof Meloidogyne javanica on the susceptible tomato, Solanum\rlycopersicum, cv.

The mechanisms of resistance are not clear, but\rsesquiterpenoids and chitinases seem to play a key role, acting as\rnematotoxic and nematostatic compounds affecting the viability of the\rnematode at various stages (Bagnaresi et al. 2013).\nAlthough all the nematode isolates tested reproduced less in the S.\rtorvum cultivars than on the susceptible eggplant, the species of\rnematode influenced the level of resistance. Indeed, high resistance\rlevels to M. incognita were found in both pot and plastic greenhouse\rexperiments, similar to other results previously reported about M.\rincognita populations from other parts of the world (Daunay and Dalmasso 1985);\r(Ali et al. 1992); (Rahman et al. 2002); (Dhivya, Sadasakthi, and Sivakumar 2014); (Uehara, Tateishi, et al. 2017). However,\rthe host suitability of S. torvum to M. javanica varied greatly from\rresistant to susceptible, as in previous reports (Daunay and Dalmasso 1985);\r(Tzortzakakis, Bletsos, and Avgelis 2006); (Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018). This variability in the\rplant–nematode interaction could be due to the genetic background of\rboth plant germplasm and RKN isolate, as has been postulated for tomato\rrootstocks (Cortada et al. 2008). For example, in this study all the S.\rtorvum cultivars responded with a moderately resistant to susceptible\rreaction to the M. javanica isolate MJ05 which reproduced 81% less\rthan the isolate MJAl05, which achieved the higher reproduction in the\rsusceptible eggplant cv. Cristal. In addition, the S. torvum rootstock\rTorpedo was more suitable to the most M. javanica isolates according\rto the reproduction index.\nThe effect of increasing Pi did not affect the S. torvum\rsuitability. Lower values of maximum multiplication rate (a) and\rmaximum population density (M) of both M. javanica and M.\rincognita on S. torvum than on the susceptible eggplant were\restimated, confirming its host status. The cropping season influenced\rthe population growth rate of all the S. torvum cultivars and of the\reggplant. The lower resistance level of the S. torvum cultivars were\robserved when cropped during autumn–winter, mainly due to a more\rpronounced reduction of the population growth rate on the susceptible\reggplant that seemed more affected than the S. torvum cultivars when\rcropped in this period. In fact, eggplant is a warm season crop affected\rby low temperatures.\nCultivar Brutus confers tolerance to M. javanica because the dry shoot\rweight of the grafted eggplant was not reduced when submitted to\rincreasing Pi but that of the ungrafted did according to the\rSeinhorst’s damage model. The estimated tolerance limit of eggplant to\rM. javanica was 10.9 J2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) of sandy soil. Di Vito et al.\r((1986)) reported a tolerance limit of 0.054 eggs and J2 of M.\rincognita per cm\\(^{3}\\) of sandy loam soil. Watanabe et al.\r((2014)) reported eggplant yield losses at Pi higher than 2\rJ2 of a mixed population of M. incognita and M. hapla per 20 g of\rclay loam soil. It is known that the tolerance limit can be influenced\rby the plant cultivar, nematode species and densities, the source of\rinoculum, soil type and cropping system (Greco and Di Vito 2009). Therefore, an\raccurate estimation of the tolerance limit must be obtained for specific\rconditions in order to be used as a decision-making tool.\nInterestingly, this study provides the first evidence of the resistance\rof S. torvum to a N-virulent M. incognita isolate. In addition,\rthe resistance to Mi1.2-virulent isolates has been corroborated in\ragreement with that of the S. torvum cultivars Tonashimu, Torero and\rTorvum vigour to two Mi1.2-virulent M. incognita from Japan, and to\rthat of cv. Hawk to a Mi1.2-virulent M. incognita from Turkey\r(Uehara, Sakurai, et al. 2017); (Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018).\nThis study points out that S. torvum is a valuable tool for managing\rM. incognita and M. javanica populations irrespective of their\r(a)virulence status to the resistant N and Mi1.2 genes, and may help\rto avoid selection for virulence to any specific R gene in growing\rsystems in which crop rotation is done. The inclusion of some more\rresistance sources in the rotation could prevent the selection to\rspecific R genes because the high specificity of the virulence to a\rgiven R gene and the fitness cost that RKN population acquires, raises\rthe possibility of counterselection by the proper use of different\rresistance sources (Djian-Caporalino et al. 2011). In fact, alternating only\rtwo resistance genes does not prevent the selection for virulence,\ralthough the level is reduced (Expósito et al. 2019). The number of\rresistance sources is expected to increase and to be available to\rgrowers in the future, as for example the accessions of Cucumis\rmetuliferus and C. amarus recently characterized as resistant to\rMi1.2 (a)virulent isolates (Expósito et al. 2018);\r(Helio A. García-Mendívil et al. 2019).\nSome other wild eggplant species, such as S. aethiopicum, S.\rsisymbriifolium and S. warscewiczii, are also resistant to the three\rtropical RKN species but less than S. torvum (Daunay and Dalmasso 1985). Despite\rthe value of S. torvum as a rootstock, it is not yet widely used\rbecause of its poor and irregular seed germination, making it necessary\rto sow it 20–30 days earlier than the scion (Oda and Lee 2003). However, seed\rtreatments that result in a high and rapid germination (Ranil et al. 2015))\rcould favour its use in the future.\n\rAcknowledgments\rThe authors thank MINECO and FEDER for funding projects\rAGL2013-49040-C2-1-R and AGL2017-89785-R, and CONACYT for providing PhD\rfunding to H.

Brutus was cultivated for two\rconsecutive years in the same plots in a plastic greenhouse to assess\rthe level of resistance to M. incognita and crop yield. At the end of\rthe second crop, the putative selection for virulence of the nematode\rsubpopulations coming from infected ungrafted and grafted eggplant was\rassessed in the eggplant and in S. torvum in a pot experiment.\rNematode population densities at transplantation in 2017 ranged from 2\rto 378 J2 per 100 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil and did not differ between ungrafted\rand grafted eggplant. At the end of each crop, higher galling index and\rnumber of nematodes in soil and in roots were registered in ungrafted\rthan grafted eggplant. The grafted eggplant performed as resistant in\r2017 and as highly resistant in 2018. Eggplant yield did not differ\rirrespective of grafting in 2017 after being cultivated for 135 days,\rbut it differed after 251 days of cultivation in 2018. In the pot\rexperiment, S. torvum performed as resistant to both M. incognita\rsubpopulations. However, the M. incognita subpopulation obtained from\rroots of S. torvum produced 49.4% less egg masses and 56% less eggs\rper plant in the eggplant than the nematode subpopulation obtained from\rroots of the eggplant cv. Cristal. The results of this study revealed\rthat the infective and reproductive fitness of the nematode decrease\rwithout having been selected for virulence.\n2\nIntroduction\rEggplant,Solanum melongena, is one of the most cultivated solanaceous\rcrops with an estimated worldwide production of c. 52 million tonnes in\r1.8 million ha (FAOSTAT 2017). Root-knot nematodes (RKN),\rMeloidogyne spp., are one of the most damaging soilborne pathogens in\rsolanaceous crops, especially under protected cultivation\r(Hallmann and Meressa 2018). Maximum eggplant yield losses of 95% have been\rreported (Greco and Di Vito 2009). The use of resistant plants is an effective\rand economically profitable management strategy to control RKN\r(Sorribas et al. 2005)) that is environmentally friendlier than the common\rsoil nematicides (Nyczepir and Thomas 2009). In Nematology, plant resistance is\rdefined as the ability of a plant to supress infection development\rand/or reproduction of plant-parasitic nematodes (Roberts 2009).\rGrafting onto resistant rootstocks has become a common method to control\rsoilborne pathogens when no commercial resistant cultivars are available\r(Oda 2002); (Judy A. Thies, Buckner, et al. 2015). That is the case of eggplant, which has\rbeen usually grafted onto resistant tomato or interspecific hybrids such\ras S. lycopersicum \\(\\times\\) S. habrochaites (Daunay 2008).\rHowever, the expression of resistance can be limited by several factors\rlike constant soil temperatures above 30 C (Araujo et al. 1982)), and\rthe genetic background of the rootstock along with that of the nematode\rspecies (Cortada et al. 2008). Moreover, the repeated cultivation of plant\rspecies carrying the same resistance gene can select virulent nematode\rpopulations capable to overcome the plant defense mechanisms\r(Verdejo-Lucas et al. 2009); (A. Giné and Sorribas 2017); (Expósito et al. 2019). Thus, other\rresistance sources have been assessed, including S. melongena lines,\rinterspecific hybrid of S. integrifolium \\(\\times\\) S. melongena, and\rthe wild related species S. integrifolium, S. sisymbriifolium and\rS. torvum (Daunay 2008). Nonetheless, S. torvum is currently the\ronly wild species commercially available to be used as rootstock for\reggplant worldwide (Uehara, Tateishi, et al. 2017); (Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018). Several S. torvum\raccessions and cultivars have been previously described as resistant to\rM. incognita (Ali et al. 1992); (Rahman et al. 2002); (Dhivya, Sadasakthi, and Sivakumar 2014)), M. luci\r(Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018)), and to some populations of M. arenaria and M.\rjavanica (Tzortzakakis, Bletsos, and Avgelis 2006); (Uehara, Tateishi, et al. 2017); (Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018)); but\rsusceptible to M. hapla (Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018). Some S. torvum rootstocks have\rbeen recently described as a valuable tool for managing M. incognita\rand M. javanica populations from Spain, irrespective of their\r(a)virulence status to the resistance N and Mi1.2 genes in pepper\rand tomato, respectively (Helio. A. García-Mendívil, Escudero, and Sorribas 2019). Nevertheless, no\rinformation about the effect of the continuous cultivation of S.\rtorvum on selecting for virulence and on the nematode fitness has been\rpreviously reported. Therefore, experiments were conducted to estimate\rthe effect of two-year cultivation in the same plot under plastic\rgreenhouse conditions on M. incognita population densities, disease\rseverity, eggplant yield, selection for virulence and nematode fitness.\n\rMaterials and methods\rEffect of S. torvum on M. incognita reproduction, disease severity and eggplant yield cultivated in plastic greenhouse\rThe experiment was conducted in a 700 m\\(^{2}\\) plastic greenhouse located\rat Viladecans (Barcelona, Spain). The soil texture was sandy loam with\r83.8% sand, 6.7% loam and 9.5% clay; pH 8.7; 1.8% of organic matter\r(w/w) and 0.5 dS/m electrical conductivity. The soil was infested in\r2014 with the avirulent Mi1.2 gene isolate Agropolis from M.\rincognita coming from a single egg mass and multiplied in the\rsusceptible tomato cv. Durinta (Expósito et al. 2019). The plots used in\rthe experiment were previously cultivated with the rotation\rlettuce-French bean-eggplant. The experiment consisted of two\rtreatments: the eggplant cv. Cristal (Semillas Fitó) grafted onto the\rS. torvum cv. Brutus (Semillas Fitó), and the ungrafted eggplant cv.\rCristal as standard for comparison. Each treatment was replicated 10\rtimes in plots with a narrow variation on nematode densities between\rtreatments at transplantation. Crops were carried out from June 16 to\rOctober 29 2017 (135 d) and from March 20 to November 26 2018 (251 d)\rand plots maintained in black fallow between cropping seasons.\rIndividual plots consisted of a row of 2.5 m with 4 plants spaced 0.6 m\rapart plots within a row were spaced 1 m. Plants of each treatment were\rcultivated in the same plot each year to determine the effect on M.\rincognita population densities, the disease severity, the crop yield\rand the durability of the resistance. Soil of each plot was prepared\rindividually to avoid cross contamination. Plants were irrigated as\rneeded trough a drip irrigation system and fertilized with a solution of\rNPK (15-5-30) at 31 kg/ha, iron chelate and micronutrients at 0.9 kg/ha.\rWeeds were removed manually before and during the cropping season. Fruit\ryield were determined weekly between 8 and 17 weeks after\rtransplantation in 2017, and between 11 and 31 weeks in 2018. Soil\rtemperatures and water content were recorded daily at 1 h intervals with\rdigital probes 5TM (Decagon devices, Inc.) placed at 15 cm depth.\nThe initial nematode populaion densities(Pi) in soil were quantified\rat transplantation and the final population densities (Pf) at the end\rof the crops. Soil samples were taken from each experimental plot and\rconsisted of eight cores taken from the first 30 cm of soil with an\rauger of diameter 2.5 cm that were mixed and passed through a 4 mm pore\rsieve to remove stones. The second-stage juveniles (J2) were extracted\rfrom 500 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil and incubated at 27 \\(\\pm\\) 2 C for one week,\rusing Baermann trays (Whitehead and Hemming 1965). J2 were collected using a 25\r\\(\\mu\\)m aperture screen, counted, and expressed as J2/100 cm\\(^{3}\\) of\rsoil. At the end of the crop, roots were carefully uprooted, washed, and\rthe galling index (GI) evaluated on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 =\rcomplete and healthy root system and 10 = plants and roots dead\r(Zeck 1971). After that, the number of eggs/plant was assessed\rextracting them from roots by blender maceration in a 5% commercial\rbleach solution (Hussey and Barker 1973)) and counted. Reproduction\rindex (RI) was calculated as the percentage of eggs produced in the\rrootstock with regard to that in the eggplant cultivar. The response of\rthe rootstock was categorized according to the RI as highly resistant\r(RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 1%), resistant (1% \\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 10%), moderately resistant (10%\r\\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 25%), slightly resistant (25% \\(\\leq\\) RI \\(\u0026lt;\\) 50%) or\rsusceptible (RI \\(\\geq\\) 50%) (Hadisoeganda 1982).\n\rSelection for virulence and nematode fitness\rAt the end of the plastic greenhouse experiment in 2018, two nematode\rsubpopulations were considered according to the plant species in which\rthey were produced, that is, eggplant or S. torvum. The eggs extracted\rfrom roots of the ungrafted eggplant were inoculated in Baermann trays\rat 27 \\(\\pm\\) 2 C to allow J2 emergence to determine the putative\rselection for virulence in a pot experiment. J2 emerged in the first 24\rh were discarded. Nematodes were collected daily for 10 days using a 25\r\\(\\mu\\)m sieve, and stored at 9 C until inoculation. Seeds of the S.\rtorvum cv. Brutus were pre-treated with a KNO\\(_{3}\\) solution to improve\rgermination (Ranil et al. 2015)), transferred to vermiculite filled trays and\rincubated in a growth chamber at 25 \\(\\pm\\) 2 C and 16:8h (light:dark)\rphotoperiod for four weeks. Afterwards, the seedlings were transplanted\rto 200 cm\\(^{3}\\) pots containing sterile sand and maintained in a growth\rchamber at 25 \\(\\pm\\) 2 C with a 16:8 h (light:dark) photoperiod for a\rweek, and inoculated with 1 J2/cm\\(^{3}\\) sand. Each treatment was\rreplicated 10 times. Plants were maintained in the growth chamber for 55\rdays. Plants were watered as needed throughout the experiment and\rfertilized with a slow-release fertilizer (15% N, 9% P\\(_{2}\\)O\\(_{5}\\), 12%\rK\\(_{2}\\)O, 2% MgO\\(_{2}\\), microelements; Osmocote Plus). Soil temperatures\rwere recorded daily at 30 min intervals with PT100 probes (Campbell\rScientific Ltd).\nAt the end of the experiments, the roots were carefully washed, the GI\revaluated, the number of egg masses and egg/plant determined, the number\rof eggs/egg mass and RI calculated, and the level of resistance\rcategorized following the procedures previously stated.\n\rStatistical analysis\rStatistical analyses were performed using R Statistical software version\r3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The\rdata were not normally distributed according to the normal Shapiro–Wilk\rW test. Then, the non-parametric analyses Mann–Whitney U test was\rused for paired comparisons between plant species per cropping season,\rbetween plant species per each M. incognita subpopulation and between\rM. incognita subpopulations per each plant species.\n\r\rResults\rEffect of S. torvum on M. incognita reproduction, disease severity and eggplant yield cultivated in plastic greenhouse\rThe minimum and maximum soil temperatures during the cropping season in\r2017 ranged from 21.1 C to 29.9 C, and from 14.6 C to 31.3 C in 2018.\rThe nematode population densities in soil at transplantation in 2017\rranged from 2 to 378 J2/100 cm\\(^{3}\\) of soil and did not differ (P \\(\u0026lt;\\)\r0.05) between treatments.

In 2018, the nematode population densities\rin soil at transplantation were between 94 and 98% less than those\rregistered at the end of the crop in 2017 but differed (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05)\rbetween treatments. At the end of the crop, a higher (P \\(\u0026lt;\\) 0.05) GI\rand number of J2 in soil and eggs in roots were also registered in\rungrafted than grafted eggplant.

The resistance of S. torvum\rseems to be more stable than other R-genes in fruiting solanaceous\rcrops such as tomato and pepper. In tomato, the selection for virulence\rto the Mi1.2 gene can be acquired progressively crop by crop of\rresistant tomato cultivars (A. Giné and Sorribas 2017)) or rootstocks\r(Verdejo-Lucas et al. 2009)), or suddenly just after one tomato crop grafted\ronto the resistant rootstock cv. Aligator (Expósito et al. 2019).\rRegarding pepper, the selection for virulence to the Me3 gene has been\rreported after two consecutive pepper crops grafted onto the rootstock\rcv. Atlante (Ros-Ibáñez et al. 2014). In relation to the N gene, virulence\rhas been reported in the USA but without any information on the\rselection process (Thies 2011). Yang et al. ((2014)) consider\rthat the entire disease resistance pathway is amplified in S. torvum\rcompared with tomato and potato enhancing plant defense mechanisms and\rresistance durability.\nThe acquisition of virulence to a R-gene can have a fitness cost for\rthe nematode in susceptible cultivars of the same plant species\r(Petrillo and Roberts 2005); (Castagnone-Sereno, Bongiovanni, and Wajnberg 2007); (Djian-Caporalino et al. 2011);\r(Expósito et al. 2019)) after a minimum number of exposures to this\rR-gene. For example, three resistant tomato crops were needed to\raffect the infectivity, reproduction and fecundity of a partially\rvirulent M. incognita subpopulation in susceptible tomato compared to\rthe avirulent subpopulation (Expósito et al. 2019). Surprisingly, the\rresults of this study revealed that the infective and reproductive\rfitness of the nematode decreased without having been selected for\rvirulence after two years of repeated cultivation. The causes for this\rloss of fitness as well as the stability of this characteristic should\rbe investigated. In a nematode field population a certain proportion of\rinfective J2 can counteract the S. torvum resistance in a proportion\rthat is maintained in the offspring irrespective of the plant resistance\rstatus in which they were originated, as it was observed in our\rexperiment. Nonetheless, the proportion of the offspring originated in\rS. torvum has a fitness cost manifested in susceptible eggplant. This\rfinding can have important consequences for managing M. incognita by\ragronomic methods since the nematode reproduction in susceptible\reggplant decreased about 56%. Therefore, the use of different resistant\rsources in rotation with susceptible ones will decrease the risk of\rselecting virulent nematode populations. Solanaceae and\rCucurbitaceae are the two most common botanical families used in\rrotation under protected cultivation (Moncada et al. 2013). In addition to\rthe commercially available resistant tomato, pepper and eggplant\rcultivars and/or rootstocks, some other resistance sources in the\rCucurbitaceae family such as Cucumis metuliferus and Citrullus\ramarus could be used as rootstocks in rotation schemes. Moreover, the\rresistance of C. metuliferus, C. amarus and S. torvum is also\rexpressed against virulent populations to the Mi-1.2 and N\rresistance genes (Expósito et al. 2018); (Helio A. García-Mendívil et al. 2019). Plant\rresistance is an effective and economically profitable control method\r(Sorribas et al. 2005)) that can be durable if it is used in a proper manner\r(Djian-Caporalino et al. 2011); (Davies and Elling 2015). Among the proposed strategies\rto increase resistance durability, alternating only two resistance genes\rreduce virulence selection but not prevent it (Expósito et al. 2019).\rIncluding more resistance sources, some of them having a fitness cost\rfor the nematode such as that in S. torvum, could prevent the\rselection for virulence to specific R-genes and could also reduce the\rinfective and reproductive capability of the nematode in susceptible\rgermplasm.\nIn relation to crop yield, significant differences between ungrafted and\rgrafted eggplant were only detected at long cropping periods. An\reggplant yield increase of 27% was recorded when cultivated during 9\rmonths, but no differences were found at cropping periods shorter than\r6.5 months (Çürük et al. 2009); (Gisbert et al. 2011); (Moncada et al. 2013);\r(Sabatino, Palazzolo, and D’Anna 2013), (2019); (Miceli et al. 2014); (Bogoescu and Doltu 2015). In\rour study, grafted eggplant yielded a 110% more than the ungrafted when\rcropped during 8.3 months, but did not differ when cultivated during 4.5\rmonths.\nIn summary, grafted eggplant onto S. torvum can yield significantly\rmore in nematode infested soil depending on Pi and/or crop duration\rand is a valuable tool for managing the three tropical Meloidogyne\rspp. irrespective of its (a)virulence status to other R-genes in\rfruiting solanaceous crops; it reduces the infective and reproductive\rfitness of the nematode in susceptible after two consecutive crops\rwithout selecting for nematode virulence. However, special attention has\rto be taken in relation to variants of the nematode able to overcome\rresistance in S. torvum. Recently, the genotype A2-J of M. arenaria\rfrom Japan has been reported as virulent to S. torvum, but not the\rA2-O. Interestingly, the distribution area of the genotype A2-J overlaps\rwith the cultivation area of eggplant (Uehara, Tateishi, et al. 2017). Additional long\rterm studies will be necessary to determine the resistance durability.\n\rAcknowledgments\rThe authors thank MINECO and FEDER for funding projects\rAGL2013-49040-C2-1-R and AGL2017-89785-R, and CONACYT for providing PhD\rfunding to H.

Particularly interesting, performed as resistant to virulent\risolates to the Mi1.2 and N resistance genes of tomato and pepper,\rrespectively. Reports about virulent populations are increasing\r(Ornat, Verdejo-Lucas, and Sorribas 2007); (Verdejo-Lucas et al. 2009); (Thies 2011);\r(Verdejo-Lucas, Talavera, and Andrés 2012); (Ros-Ibáñez et al. 2014); (Uehara, Tateishi, et al. 2017); (Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018).\rThen, the use of the studied rootstocks in growing areas with such\rvirulent populations could be remarkable help to deal with this issue.\nAs population dynamic parameters pointed out, the response of the C.\ramarus and S. torvum rootstocks to increasing nematode densities also\rrevealed its exceptionally poor hosts status. Interestingly, both were\rless suitable host for M. incognita than for M. javanica. Previous\rresearch also found C. amarus accessions and S. torvum rootstocks to\rbe resistant to M. incognita (Rahman et al. 2002); (Huitrón et al. 2007);\r(Dhivya, Sadasakthi, and Sivakumar 2014); (Thies et al. 2008); (2009); (2015);\r(2015); (2015); (Uehara, Sakurai, et al. 2017)), and for S. torvum, a\rwide range of responses to M. javanica (Daunay 2008);\r(Tzortzakakis, Bletsos, and Avgelis 2006); (Öçal, Özalp, and Devran 2018). Interestingly, in contrast with the\rcucurbit species studied, an apparent decrease in root fibrosity seems\rto be associated with increases in a and M values, and relatively\rlow E values compared to M. Besides lower values of a and M.\nC. amarus and S. torvum showed the same ability to maintain its\rresistance levels after being cultivated for two consecutive growing\rseasons in the same plot. Previous studies found evidence of partial or\rcomplete loss of resistance in tomato or pepper germplasm carrying the\rMi1.2, Me3 or N R-genes in the same number of seasons\r(Castagnone-Sereno, Bongiovanni, and Wajnberg 2007); (Verdejo-Lucas et al. 2009); (Thies 2011);\r(A. Giné and Sorribas 2017); (Expósito et al. 2019). Then, it is an indicator of\rdurability of resistance. In addition, both rootstocks studied had an\rinfective and reproductive fitness cost for the nematode. That is, the\rreproduction of the nematode population coming from grafted watermelon\ror eggplant was less than 50% when inoculated in a susceptible\rwatermelon or eggplant, compared to the reproduction of a population\rcoming from a susceptible host. This acquisition of fitness cost in a\rsusceptible cultivar have been previously reported after a minimum\ramount of exposures to the same R-gene (Petrillo and Roberts 2005);\r(Castagnone-Sereno, Bongiovanni, and Wajnberg 2007); (Djian-Caporalino et al. 2011); (Expósito et al. 2019)),\rbut only at the expense of virulence selection. The effect of this\rfitness cost on rotation schemes including resistant and susceptible\rgermplasm should be studied in field conditions.\nTolerance to the nematode population densities evaluated in this thesis\rwas also found in rootstocks of both families, as no difference in dry\rtop weight were found. This was also evidenced in the plastic greenhouse\rexperiments, where rootstock-scion compatibility was manifested in yield\rincrements, more than double in some cases, when compared with ungrafted\rplants. In accordance, previous studies also found increments, or at\rleast no differences, in yield of both watermelon (Judy A. Thies, Ariss, et al. 2015);\r(2015)b) and eggplant (Çürük et al. 2009); (Gisbert et al. 2011);\r(Moncada et al. 2013); (Sabatino, Palazzolo, and D’Anna 2013), (2019); (Miceli et al. 2014);\r(Bogoescu and Doltu 2015). Another remark on this subject, was the work done by\rthe Dr Maria Belén Picó and Dr. Carmina Gisbert, described in chapter 1,\rthat showed null effect of the CI67 accession over the watermelon fruit\rquality, which was in accordance with Fredes et al. ((2017)),\rthat also found similar results when grafting the F1 hybrid cv. Oneida\ronto CI67. Although this thesis have not evaluated eggplant fruit\rquality, previous research also found no negative effects on yield and\rquality, however, it may increase the size of fruit and also reduce its\rlightness and saturation of color, thus, more research on the effect of\rgrafting on fruit quality needs to be done to assure the standards\rdemanded by the market.\nIn summary, a) the poor host status to a wide range of populations,\rincluded some virulent to most cultivated R-genes, b) the absent\rselection for virulence after two cropping seasons in the same plot, c)\rthe fitness cost acquired by the nematode population, and d) the effect\ron crop yield, makes evident the usefulness of both, C. amarus and S.\rtorvum, to be employed in rotation schemes. Previous studies found that\rthe inclusion of only two genetic sources of resistance in a rotation\rscheme are not enough to avoid virulence selection (Expósito et al. 2019)),\rhowever, it does reduce its levels. Thus, including these two more\rsources of resistance could be a solution to avoid virulence selection\rand improving crop yield. Some experiments to assess the validity of\rthis hypothesis are currently ongoing. That should be studied in the\rfuture.\n\rConclusions\rConclusions on C. amarus accessions:\n\rThe C. amarus accessions BGV0005164 and BGV0005167 are resistant\rto Meloidogyne isolates belonging to the three most widespread RKN\rspecies, including one virulent to the Mi1.2 resistance gene.\n\rC. amarus accessions are less suitable host for M. incognita\rthan for M. javanica.\n\rWatermelon cv. Sugar baby and both C. amarus accessions are\rtolerant to M. incognita and M. javanica.\n\rCropping both C. amarus accessions two consecutive growing seasons\rin the same plots are not enough time to reduce its resistance\rlevels nor to select for virulence in M. incognita, but it has an\rinfective and reproductive fitness cost for the nematode in\rwatermelon.\n\rGrafting onto both C. amarus accessions improves watermelon yield.\n\r\rConclusions on S. torvum rootstocks:\n\rS. torvum rootstocks are resistant to several M. incognita and\rM. javanica isolates, including two virulent isolates to the\rMi1.2 gene and, for first time reported, N resistance gene.\n\rS. torvum rootstocks are less suitable host for M. incognita\rthan for M. javanica.\n\rThe cropping season influence the population growth rate of the\rnematode in S. torvum rootstocks and, to a higher degree, in\reggplant.\n\rCultivar Brutus confers tolerance to M. javanica.\n\rCropping S. torvum two consecutive growing seasons in the same\rplots do not select for virulence in M. incognita but has an\rinfective and reproductive fitness cost for the nematode in\reggplant.\n\rGrafting onto S. torvum improves eggplant yield when cultivated\rfor long periods (8.3 months), but does not differ when cultivated\rin shorter periods (4.5 months).\n\r\rGeneral conclusion\n\rRootstocks from both families present particularly useful\rcharacteristics that suggest its convenience to be employed in\rrotation scheme as supplementary genetic source of resistance in\rorder to increase its diversity.\r\r2\nAbad, Pierre, Bruno Favery, Marie-Noelle Rosso, and Philippe Castagnone-Sereno. 2003. “Root-knot nematode parasitism and host response: molecular basis of a sophisticated interaction.” Molecular Plant Pathology 4 (4): 217–24. https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1364-3703.2003.00170.x.\n\rAli, Mohammad, Naotaka Matsuzoe, Hiroshi Okubo, and Kunimitsu Fujieda. 1992. “Resistance of Non-tuberous Solanum to Root-knot Nematode.” Horticultural Science 60 (4): 921–26. https://doi.org/10.2503/jjshs.60.921.\n\rAraujo, M.

Con el siguiente codigo seleccionamos las variables independientes y de respuesta que analizaremos posteriormente.\n\rSubset:\r\r####Eggs PER PLANT ####\rSub.Eggs \u0026lt;- subset(mydata,\rselect=c(Nger, Isolate, EggsP) ) ##Create a subset of the desire variable\r\rEstadística descriptiva\rPara este ejemplo nuestro objetivo es saber si las variables germoplasma (Nger) y aislado (Isolate) influyen significativamente sobre la variable numero de huevos por planta (EggsP). El siguiente método ilustra de manera sencilla como calcular y almacenar las respuestas necesarias para realizar un reporte de resultados.\nEn principio, nuestro conjunto de datos se compone de 5 tratamientos en germoplasma y 11 en aislados. Esto nos permite realizar nuestro análisis desde dos enfoques: intentar conocer si existe diferencia significativa entre el numero de huevos de cada aislado que se reprodujo en cada germoplasma, o si un mismo aislado se reproduce de manera diferente en cada uno de los germoplasmas. En este post nos enfocaremos en el primero, el analisis de cuatro tratamientos, germoplasmas, para 11 aislados diferentes.\nDado que nuestro conjunto de datos contiene una etiqueta especifica para cada tratamiento, podemos hacer buen uso de Copiar y Pegar, y Buscar y Reemplazar, para ahorrarnos un poco de trabajo. En este caso, solo necesitamos realizar el analisis para un aislado, y para el resto de ellos solo reemplazar su etiqueta por la del siguiente aislado. En futuras entradas se describirá como automatizar este proceso.\n\rManejo de datos\rPara obtener los datos de nuestro primer aislado utilizamos nuevamente el comando subset, al cual le añadimos el parametro Isolate == “MIAd” para seleccionar solo los datos asociados a la etiqueta MIAd en la columna Isolate, y seleccionamos los datos de la columna Nger y EggsP. La siguiente linea indica que los valores de la columna Nger sean tratados como factores.\n####Isolate: MIAd####\rSub.Eggs.MIAd \u0026lt;- subset(Sub.Eggs, Isolate == \u0026quot;MIAd\u0026quot;, select=c(Nger, EggsP)) Sub.Eggs.MIAd$Nger = factor (Sub.Eggs.MIAd$Nger, labels=c(\u0026quot;EC\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;TB\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;TE\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;TS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;TT\u0026quot;)) \r\rPromedios y error estándar\rPara reportar resultados es necesario conocer el promedio y el error estandar de cada uno de los germoplasmas. Para ello, las primeras 5 lineas de codigo se repiten para cada tratamiento. Primero se obtiene el subconjunto del tratamiento y se almacena en la variable. A partir de esta variable se calculan el promedio y el error estandar por medio de los comandos mean y se, del paquete ___, se almacenan en su propia variable, y se redondea el valor a dos digitos (round).\n###Descriptive statistics calculation###\rSub.Eggs.MIAd.EC \u0026lt;- subset(Sub.Eggs.MIAd, Nger == \u0026quot;EC\u0026quot;, select=c(Nger,EggsP))\rMe.EP.MIAd.EC \u0026lt;- mean(Sub.Eggs.MIAd.EC$EggsP, na.mr=FALSE)\rMe.EP.MIAd.EC \u0026lt;- round(Me.EP.MIAd.EC, digits=2)\rSe.EP.MIAd.EC \u0026lt;- se(Sub.Eggs.MIAd.EC$EggsP)\rSe.EP.MIAd.EC \u0026lt;- round(Se.EP.MIAd.EC, digits=2)\rSub.Eggs.MIAd.SB \u0026lt;- subset(Sub.Eggs.MIAd, Nger == \u0026quot;TB\u0026quot;, select=c(Nger,EggsP))\rMe.EP.MIAd.TB \u0026lt;- mean(Sub.Eggs.MIAd.SB$EggsP, na.mr=FALSE)\rMe.EP.MIAd.TB \u0026lt;- round(Me.EP.MIAd.TB, digits=2)\rSe.EP.MIAd.TB \u0026lt;- se(Sub.Eggs.MIAd.SB$EggsP)\rSe.EP.MIAd.TB \u0026lt;- round(Se.EP.MIAd.TB, digits=2)\rSub.Eggs.MIAd.SB \u0026lt;- subset(Sub.Eggs.MIAd, Nger == \u0026quot;TE\u0026quot;, select=c(Nger,EggsP))\rMe.EP.MIAd.TE \u0026lt;- mean(Sub.Eggs.MIAd.SB$EggsP, na.mr=FALSE)\rMe.EP.MIAd.TE \u0026lt;- round(Me.EP.MIAd.TE, digits=2)\rSe.EP.MIAd.TE \u0026lt;- se(Sub.Eggs.MIAd.SB$EggsP)\rSe.EP.MIAd.TE \u0026lt;- round(Se.EP.MIAd.TE, digits=2)\rSub.Eggs.MIAd.SB \u0026lt;- subset(Sub.Eggs.MIAd, Nger == \u0026quot;TS\u0026quot;, select=c(Nger,EggsP))\rMe.EP.MIAd.TS \u0026lt;- mean(Sub.Eggs.MIAd.SB$EggsP, na.mr=FALSE)\rMe.EP.MIAd.TS \u0026lt;- round(Me.EP.MIAd.TS, digits=2)\rSe.EP.MIAd.TS \u0026lt;- se(Sub.Eggs.MIAd.SB$EggsP)\rSe.EP.MIAd.TS \u0026lt;- round(Se.EP.MIAd.TS, digits=2)\rSub.Eggs.MIAd.SB \u0026lt;- subset(Sub.Eggs.MIAd, Nger == \u0026quot;TT\u0026quot;, select=c(Nger,EggsP))\rMe.EP.MIAd.TT \u0026lt;- mean(Sub.Eggs.MIAd.SB$EggsP, na.mr=FALSE)\rMe.EP.MIAd.TT \u0026lt;- round(Me.EP.MIAd.TT, digits=2)\rSe.EP.MIAd.TT \u0026lt;- se(Sub.Eggs.MIAd.SB$EggsP)\rSe.EP.MIAd.TT \u0026lt;- round(Se.EP.MIAd.TT, digits=2)\r\rKruskal–Wallis test\rUna vez obtenidos los valores de promedios y error estandar, podemos dejarlos de lado y proceder a las pruebas estadisticas. Dado que se sabe que los datos no pertenecen a una distribucion normal, el analisis no-paramétrico Kruskall-Wallis se calcula utilizando la función kruskal.test del paquete ____ (las pruebas de normalidad las pondré en otra entrada). En este caso, el resultado se guarda en la variable KTMIAd, que será útil más adelante. Para comprender mejor porqué, se llama a la variable para ver que resultado arroja. Se observa que tenemos un valor de P igual a 0.00007, existe diferencia significativa entre los tratamientos. La funcion ls “devuelve un vector de cadenas de caracteres que dan los nombres de los objetos en el entorno especificado”, y con ella podemos ver que el valor de P se encuentra almacenado bajo el nombre de p.value y podemos llamarlo mediante variable$nombre.\n####Kruskal-Wallis test calculation####\rKTMIAd = kruskal.test(Sub.Eggs.MIAd$EggsP ~ Sub.Eggs.MIAd$Nger)\rKTMIAd\r## ## Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\r## ## data: Sub.Eggs.MIAd$EggsP by Sub.Eggs.MIAd$Nger\r## Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 30, df = 4, p-value = 0.000007\rls(KTMIAd)\r## [1] \u0026quot;data.name\u0026quot; \u0026quot;method\u0026quot; \u0026quot;p.value\u0026quot; \u0026quot;parameter\u0026quot; \u0026quot;statistic\u0026quot;\rKTMIAd$p.value\r## [1] 0\r\rDunn’s test\rLa prueba anterior indica si existe, o no, diferencia entre los tratamientos.

In the pot experiments, plants were inoculated with a second-stage juvenile per cm3 of sterile sand and maintained in a growth chamber at 25 C for 50 days. The watermelon cv. Sugar Baby was included as a susceptible control for comparison. At the end of the experiments, the number of egg masses and eggs per plant was determined, and the reproduction index was calculated as the percentage of the number of eggs produced in the C. amarus accessions with regard to that produced in the susceptible cv. Sugar Baby. In the plastic greenhouse experiment, the ungrafted watermelon cv. Sugar Baby and watermelons grafted onto each of the C. amarus accessions and onto the watermelon rootstock cv. Robusta were cultivated from May to August 2016 in plots with nematode densities from 46 to 1392 J2 per 250 cm3 of soil at transplantation. At the end of the experiment, the galling index and the number of eggs per plant were determined, and the reproduction index was calculated. Additionally, the compatibility of the two accessions with the watermelon cv. Sugar Baby and the effect on fruit quality (weight, size, shape, firmness, pH, total soluble solids, and flesh color) were assessed under a hydroponic system in a greenhouse. The commercial rootstocks cv. Cobalt and cv. Robusta were also included. All the Meloidogyne isolates produced less egg masses and eggs per plant on the accessions than on Sugar Baby. Both accessions performed as resistant against M. arenaria, and from highly to moderately resistant to M. incognita and M. javanica in pot experiments. In the plastic greenhouse experiment, both C. amarus accessions performed as resistant to M. incognita. Both C. amarus accessions were compatible with the watermelon cv. Sugar Baby, but only the BGV0005167 accession did not influence the fruit quality. Then, the BGV0005167 accession is a promising rootstock for managing the three tropical root-knot nematode species without influencing watermelon fruit quality.\nThe response of ungrafted and grafted watermelon cv. Sugar baby onto the C. amarus accessions BGV0005164 and BGV0005167 submitted to increasing densities of M. incognita and M. javanica was studied in pot experiments to determine the maximum multiplication rate, the maximum population density and the equilibrium density of the root-knot nematode species and the effect on shoot dry biomass of watermelon. In plastic greenhouse conditions, the ungrafted and grafted watermelon onto both C. amarus accessions, and onto the C. lanatus rootstock cv. Robusta were cultivated for two consecutive years in the same plots to assess the level of resistance to M. incognita and crop yield. Additionally, after the second crop, the putative selection for virulence in the nematode subpopulation originated in the ungrafted and grafted watermelon was assessed in pot experiments. The maximum multiplication rate, the maximum population density and the equilibrium density values of both Meloidogyne species were lower in grafted than ungrafted watermelon. In the plastic greenhouse experiment, the nematode densities in soil at transplantation ranged from 1 to 53 J2 per 100 cm3^{3} of soil in 2017 and did not differ between grafted and ungrafted watermelons. At the end of the crop, the galling index and the number of eggs per plant was higher in ungrafted than in grafted watermelon both years. The C. amarus accessions performed from highly resistant to resistant to M. incognita, and the rootstock cv. Robusta from moderately resistant in 2017 to slightly resistant in 2018. The repeated cultivation of grafted watermelon onto C. amarus accessions did not select for virulence. All grafted watermelons yielded more kg per plant than the ungrafted in both years. The results of this study highlight the poorer host status of CI64 and CI67 accessions to M. incognita and M. javanica compared to watermelon; the stability of the C. amarus resistance; and the beneficial effect of C. amarus on watermelon yield when cultivated in Meloidogyne infested soils.\nSeveral experiments were carried out to assess the performance of commercial Solanum torvum cultivars against the root knot nematodes Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica in Spain. The response of S. torvum rootstock cultivars Brutus, Espina, Salutamu and Torpedo against M. incognita and Mi1.2 (a)virulent M. javanica isolates was determined in pot experiments, and of ‘Brutus’ to an N-virulent isolate of M. incognita, compared with that of the eggplant S. melongena ‘Cristal.’ The relationship between the initial and final population densities of M. javanica on ungrafted and grafted ‘Cristal’ onto the S. torvum ‘Brutus’ was assessed, together with the effect on dry shoot biomass. Finally, the population growth rate and the resistance level of the four S. torvum cultivars against M. incognita was assessed under plastic greenhouse conditions in two cropping seasons. All S. torvum rootstocks responded as resistant to the M. incognita isolates and from highly resistant to susceptible against M. javanica isolates. The maximum multiplication rates of M. javanica on the ungrafted or grafted eggplant were 270 and 49, respectively, and the equilibrium densities were 1318 and 2056 eggs and J2 per 100 cm3^{3} soil, respectively. The tolerance of the ungrafted eggplant was 10.9 J2 per 100 cm3^{3} soil, and the minimum relative dry shoot biomass was 0.76. The population growth rate of M. incognita on eggplant cv. Cristal differed from that of the S. torvum cultivars in both cropping seasons. These results suggest that S. torvum is a valuable rootstock for managing the two Meloidogyne species irrespective of the (a)virulence status.\nThe ungrafted and grafted eggplant, Solanum melongena, cv. Cristal onto the S. torvum rootstock cv. Brutus were cultivated for two consecutive years in the same plots in a plastic greenhouse to assess the level of resistance to M. incognita and crop yield. Moreover, at the end of the second crop, the putative selection for virulence of the nematode subpopulations comming infected ungrafted and grafted eggplant was assessed in the eggplant and the S. torvum in a pot experiment. Nematode population densities at transplantation in 2017 ranged from 2 to 378 J2 per 100 cm3^{3} of soil and did not differ between ungrafted and grafted eggplant. At the end of each crop, higher galling index and number of nematodes in soil and in roots were registered in ungrafted than grafted eggplant. The grafted eggplant performed as resistant in 2017 and as highly resistant in 2018. Eggplant yield did not differ irrespective of grafting in 2017 after being cultivated for 135 days, but it differed after 251 days of cultivation in 2018. In the pot experiment, S. torvum performed as resistant to both M. incognita subpopulations. However, the M. incognita subpopulation obtained from roots of S. torvum produced 49.4% less egg masses and 56% less eggs/plant in the eggplant than the nematode subpopulation obtained from roots of the eggplant cv. Cristal. The results of this study revealed that the infective and reproductive fitness of the nematode decrease without having been selected for virulence.\n","description":"","id":15,"section":"publication","tags":null,"title":"Durability of resistance to Meloidogyne mediated by R-genes in solanaceous and cucurbitaceous crops","uri":"/es/publication/book/book_any_folder_name_1/"}]
