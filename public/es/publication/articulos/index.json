However, there are currently no commercially available rootstocks resistant to Meloidogyne for cucurbit crops, and also a narrow diversity for fruiting solanaceous crops. Then, the main aim of this thesis was to determine the durability of resistance to Meloidogyne of Citrullus amarus and Solanum torvum as potential rootstocks for watermelon and eggplant, respectively...","authors":["García-Mendívil,H.A."],"booktitle":null,"id":0,"publication":"Introducción","publishDate":"2020-12-12T00:00:00Z","shorttitle":"Introduccion","tags":null,"title":"Durability of resistance to Meloidogyne mediated by R-genes in Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae crops","uri":"/es/publication/articulos/tesis/"}]
