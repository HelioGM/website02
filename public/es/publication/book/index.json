However, there are currently no commercially available rootstocks resistant to Meloidogyne for cucurbit crops, and also a narrow diversity for fruiting solanaceous crops. Then, the main aim of this thesis was to determine the durability of resistance to Meloidogyne of Citrullus amarus and Solanum torvum as potential rootstocks for watermelon and eggplant, respectively. The response of two C. amarus accessions, BGV0005164 (Cl64) and BGV0005167 (Cl67), and of S. torvum rootstock cultivars Brutus (TB), Espina, Salutamiu and Torpedo against Meloidogyne isolates from Spain, including some Mi1 .2 (a)virulent M. javanica (MJAV), and a N-virulent isolate of MINC was assessed in pot experiments, and against M. incognita (MINC) in a plastic greenhouse experiments. The watermelon cv. Sugar baby (SB) and the eggplant cv. Cristal (MC) were included for comparison. The population growth rate and the resistance level of the four S. torvum cultivars against MINC was assessed under plastic greenhouse conditions in two cropping seasons. The response of ungrafted and grafted SB onto both CI accessions and MC onto TB were submitted to increasing densities of MJAV and MINC, and MC onto TB to MJAV to determine population dynamic parameters and biomass productivity in pot experiments. In plastic greenhouse conditions, the ungrafted and grafted watermelon onto both CI accessions and eggplant onto TB were cultivated for two consecutive years in the same plots to assess the level of resistance to MINC and crop yield. After the second crop, the putative selection for virulence in the nematode subpopulation originated in the ungrafted and grafted plants· were assessed in pot experiments. Both C. amarus accessions performed as resistant to M. arenaria, and from highly to moderately resistant to MINC and MJAV in pot experiments. In the plastic greenhouse experiment, both accessions performed as resistant to MINC. The maximum multiplication rate, the maximum population density and the equilibrium density values of both Meloidogyne species were lower in grafted than ungrafted watermelon. In the plastic greenhouse experiment, the galling index and the number of eggs per plant were higher in ungrafted than in grafted plants both years. The CI accessions performed from highly resistant to resistant to MINC and yielded more kg per plant than the ungrafted in both years. Two consecutive grafted watermelon crops did not select for virulence but had an infective and reproductive fitness cost. AII the S. torvum rootstocks responded as resistant to the MINC isolates and from highly resistant to susceptible against MJAV isolates. The population growth rate of MINC on ungrafted eggplant differed from that grafted in both cropping seasons. The maximum multiplication rates of MJAV and the equilibrium densities were lower in grafted than in ungrafted eggplant. The grafted eggplant was tolerant to the range of nematode densities assessed but the ungrafted did not. In the plastic greenhouse experiment, the galling index and the density of nematodes in soil and in roots were higher in ungrafted than in grafted plants both years. The grafted eggplant performed as resistant in 2017 and as highly resistant in 2018. Eggplant yield did not differ irrespective of grafting when cultivated over 4.5 months, but it differed when cultivated over 8.3 months. Two consecutive grafted eggplant crops did not select for virulence but had an infective and reproductive fitness cost. The results of this study highlight the poor host status of the rootstocks studied; the stability of the resistance; and the beneficial effect on yield when cultivated in Meloidogyne infested soils. The causes for lost of fitness in the nematode, as well as the durability of this characteristic should be investigated.","authors":["García-Mendívil, H.A."],"booktitle":null,"id":0,"publication":null,"publishDate":"2019-10-29T00:00:00Z","shorttitle":null,"tags":null,"title":"Durability of resistance to Meloidogyne mediated by R-genes in solanaceous and cucurbitaceous crops","uri":"/es/publication/book/book_any_folder_name_1/"}]
