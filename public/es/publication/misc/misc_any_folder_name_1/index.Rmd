**Durability of resistance to *Meloidogyne* spp. mediated by *R*-genes
in solanaceous and cucurbitaceous crops**

Helio Adán García Mendívil\
**Abstract**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Watermelon, *Citrullus lanatus* var. *lanatus*, and eggplant, *Solanum
melongena*, are two major crops commonly grafted in order to overcome
soilborne diseases. However, there are currently no commercially
available rootstocks resistant to root-knot nematodes (RKN),
*Meloidogyne* spp., infection in the *Cucurbitacea* family, and also a
narrow diversity in the *Solanaceae*, mostly in tomato and pepper. In
order find alternatives to address this problem, the main objective of
this thesis was to determine the durability of resistance to
*Meloidogyne* of *Citrullus amarus* and *Solanum torvum* as potential
rootstocks for watermelon and eggplant, respectively. In the first part
of this document, the work conducted with the cucurbits is presented in
chapters one and two, while chapters three and four correspond to work
done with solanaceous.

Durabilty of *Citrullus amarus* resistance to *Meloidogyne*: the
response of two *Citrullus amarus* accessions, BGV0005164 and
BGV0005167, was assessed against different *Meloidogyne arenaria*, *M.
incognita*, and *M. javanica* isolates in pot experiments and against
*M. incognita* in plastic greenhouse. (i) In the pot experiments, plants
were inoculated with a second-stage juvenile per cm^3^ of sterile sand
and maintained in a growth chamber at 25 C for 50 days. The watermelon
cv. Sugar Baby was included as a susceptible control for comparison. At
the end of the experiments, the number of egg masses and eggs per plant
was determined, and the reproduction index was calculated as the
percentage of the number of eggs produced in the *C. amarus* accessions
with regard to that produced in the susceptible cv. Sugar Baby. (ii) In
the plastic greenhouse experiment, the ungrafted watermelon cv. Sugar
Baby and watermelon grafted onto each of the *C. amarus* accessions and
onto the watermelon rootstock cv. Robusta were cultivated from May to
August 2016 in plots with nematode densities from 46 to 1392 J2 per 250
cm^3^ of soil at transplantation. At the end of the experiment, the
galling index and the number of eggs per plant were determined, and the
reproduction index was calculated. (iii) Additionally, the compatibility
of the two accessions with the watermelon cv. Sugar Baby and the effect
on fruit quality (weight, size, shape, firmness, pH, total soluble
solids, and flesh color) were assessed under a hydroponic system in a
greenhouse. The commercial rootstocks cv. Cobalt and cv. Robusta were
also included. Moreover (iv) The response of ungrafted and grafted
watermelon cv. Sugar baby onto the *C. amarus* accessions BGV0005164 and
BGV0005167 submitted to increasing densities of *M. incognita* and *M.
javanica* was studied in pot experiments to determine the maximum
multiplication rate, the maximum population density and the equilibrium
density of the root-knot nematode species and the effect on shoot dry
biomass of watermelon. (v) In plastic greenhouse conditions, the
ungrafted and grafted watermelon onto both *C. amarus* accessions, and
onto the *C. lanatus* rootstock cv. Robusta were cultivated for two
consecutive years in the same plots to assess the level of resistance to
*M. incognita* and crop yield. (vi) Additionally, after the second crop,
the putative selection for virulence in the nematode subpopulation
originated in the ungrafted and grafted watermelon was assessed in pot
experiments. The results showed that (i) all the *Meloidogyne* isolates
produced fewer egg masses and eggs per plant in the accessions than in
Sugar Baby. Both accessions performed as resistant against *M.
arenaria*, and from highly to moderately resistant to *M. incognita* and
*M. javanica* in pot experiments. (ii) In the plastic greenhouse
experiment, both *C. amarus* accessions performed as resistant to *M.
incognita*. (iii) Both *C. amarus* accessions were compatible with the
watermelon cv. Sugar Baby, but only the BGV0005167 accession did not
influence the fruit quality. (iv) The maximum multiplication rate, the
maximum population density and the equilibrium density values of both
*Meloidogyne* species were lower in grafted than ungrafted watermelon.
(v) In the plastic greenhouse experiment, the nematode densities in soil
at transplantation ranged from 1 to 53 J2 per 100 cm^3^ of soil in
2017 and did not differ between grafted and ungrafted watermelons. At
the end of the crop, the galling index and the number of eggs per plant
was higher in ungrafted than in grafted watermelon both years. The *C.
amarus* accessions performed from highly resistant to resistant to *M.
incognita*, and the rootstock cv. Robusta from moderately resistant in
2017 to slightly resistant in 2018. All grafted watermelons yielded more
kg per plant than the ungrafted in both years. (vi) The repeated
cultivation of grafted watermelon onto *C. amarus* accessions did not
select for virulence. In conclusion, the BGV0005167 accession is a
promising rootstock for managing the three tropical root-knot nematode
species without influencing watermelon fruit quality. The results of
this study highlight the poorer host status of CI64 and CI67 accessions
to *M. incognita* and *M. javanica* compared to watermelon; the
stability of the *C. amarus* resistance; and the beneficial effect of
*C. amarus* on watermelon yield when cultivated in *Meloidogyne*
infested soils.

Durabilty of Solanum torvum resistance to Meloidogyne: several
experiments were carried out to assess the performance of commercial
*Solanum torvum* cultivars against *Meloidogyne incognita* and *M.
javanica* isolates from Spain. (i) The response of *S. torvum* rootstock
cultivars Brutus, Espina, Salutamu and Torpedo against *M. incognita*
and *Mi1.2* (a)virulent *M. javanica* isolates was determined in pot
experiments, and of cv. Brutus to an *N*-virulent isolate of *M.
incognita*, compared with that of the eggplant cv. Cristal. (ii) The
relationship between the initial and final population densities of *M.
javanica* on ungrafted and grafted 'Cristal' onto the *S. torvum*
'Brutus' was assessed, together with the effect on dry shoot biomass.
(iii) Finally, the population growth rate and the resistance level of
the four *S. torvum* cultivars against *M. incognita* was assessed under
plastic greenhouse conditions in two cropping seasons. (iv) The eggplant
*Solanum melongena* cv. Cristal, either ungrafted or grafted onto the
*S. torvum* rootstock cv. Brutus was cultivated for two consecutive
years in the same plots in a plastic greenhouse to assess the level of
resistance to *M. incognita* and crop yield. (v) At the end of the
second crop, the putative selection for virulence of the nematode
subpopulations coming from infected ungrafted and grafted eggplant was
assessed in the eggplant and in *S. torvum* in a pot experiment. The
results showed that: (i) all *S. torvum* rootstocks responded as
resistant to the *M. incognita* isolates and from highly resistant to
susceptible against *M. javanica* isolates. (ii) The maximum
multiplication rate of *M. javanica* on the ungrafted or grafted
eggplant were 270 and 49, respectively, and the equilibrium density were
1318 and 2056 eggs and J2 per 100 cm^3^ soil, respectively. The
tolerance of the ungrafted eggplant was 10.9 J2 per 100 cm^3^ soil,
and the minimum relative dry shoot biomass was 0.76. (iii) The
population growth rate of *M. incognita* on eggplant cv. Cristal
differed from that of the *S. torvum* cultivars in both cropping
seasons. (iv) Nematode population densities at transplantation in 2017
ranged from 2 to 378 J2 per 100 cm^3^ of soil and did not differ
between ungrafted and grafted eggplant. At the end of each crop, higher
galling index and number of nematodes in soil and in roots were
registered in ungrafted than grafted eggplant. The grafted eggplant
performed as resistant in 2017 and as highly resistant in 2018. Eggplant
yield did not differ irrespective of grafting in 2017 after being
cultivated for 135 days, but it differed after 251 days of cultivation
in 2018. (v) In the pot experiment, *S. torvum* performed as resistant
to both *M. incognita* subpopulations. However, the *M. incognita*
subpopulation obtained from roots of *S. torvum* produced 49.4% less egg
masses and 56% less eggs per plant in the eggplant than the nematode
subpopulation obtained from roots of the eggplant cv. Cristal. These
results suggest that *S. torvum* is a valuable rootstock for managing
the two *Meloidogyne* species irrespective of the (a)virulence status,
and revealed that the infective and reproductive fitness of the nematode
decrease without having been selected for virulence.

*Meloidogyne* spp. {#meloidogyne-spp. .unnumbered}
------------------



### Biology {#biology .unnumbered}

Root-knot nematodes (RKN), *Meloidogyne* spp., are the most damaging
plant parasitic nematodes worldwide. This genus comprises more than 100
species, however, most of the crop yield losses are caused by four of
them: the tropical species *M. arenaria*, *M. incognita* and *M.
javanica*, and the temperate species *M. hapla* [@Jones2013]. The
widened global warming can favor the expansion and proliferation of the
RKN tropical species in areas where the temperate RKN species
predominates. This fact evidence the importance of focusing research
efforts for designing management strategies to the tropical RKN species.

RKN are obligated parasites that require a suitable host plant for life
cycle completion (Fig.
[1](#fig:LifeCycle03){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:LifeCycle03"}). The infective pre-parasitic vermiform
second-stage juveniles (J2) of *Meloidogyne* moves through the soil and
penetrate the root behind the tip, by using their protractible stylet
and releasing secretions containing cell-wall-degrading enzymes
[@Abad2003]. J2 then migrate intercellularly between the cortical
cells towards the root tip where they make a U-turn to later enter into
the vascular cylinder and moves until stablishing a feeding site. Each
J2 is able to induce the redifferentiation of five to seven
parenchymatic root cells into multinucleate and hypertrophied feeding
cells, the so-called giant cells, from which get the nutrients needed
for its life cycle completion [@Nyczepir2009a]. The accumulation of
these giant cells is responsible for the characteristic galled tissue
present in infected root systems, and for the disturbance of plant
development, defenses, and metabolism [@Shukla2018]. Once infection
occurs, juveniles become sedentary and assume a "sausage" shape as
increases its size. J2 then moults three times achieving the adult
stage. The tropical species, *M. arenaria, M. incognita* and *M.
javanica*, reproduce parthenogenetically. The sedentary pearl-shaped
adult female keeps feeding from the giant cells and is able to lay c.
300-500 eggs inside a gelatinous mass. Under unfavourable conditions
(high nematode density, scarcity of food or stressed plants) the
juveniles develop into males. Interestingly, some studies have found to
increase stimulation towards maleness by cropping several cucurbit
species [@Fassuliotis1970; @Walters2006; @ExpositoA.2019c].

```


*Meloidogyne* spp. is a poikilothermic organism, meaning that
temperature influence its life cycle and determine its length
[@Tyler1933]. The nematode development occurs between 10 and 32 C, and
needs to accumulate an amount of degree-days (K) at a certain basal
temperature (Tb) to complete its life cycle [@Trudgill1995]. For
instance, it has been reported that *Meloidogyne* spp. requires between
600 and 700 accumulated degree-days with a base temperature of 10 C to
complete its life cycle in tomato [@Ferris1985]. However, the thermal
time requirements for life cycle completion can differ between RKN
populations of a given species depending of its geographic origin,
showing its ability to adapt to environmental factors, i.e., optimal
temperatures of 25-30C and 32-34C were found in populations of *M.
javanica* from Australia and California, respectively [@Ferris1979].
Such adaptive ability may be one of the main reasons of its success in
spreading globally, and also evidence its importance for modern
agriculture.

### Economic importance {#economic-importance .unnumbered}

The occurrence of soilborne diseases and pests have increased in recent
years as consequence of the intensive cultivation needed to supply a
growing population in limited land resources [@Thies2015c]. A
comprehensive summary of the estimation of yield losses caused by RKN in
several crops have been published by Greco and Di Vito [-@Greco2009a].
The cucurbit and solanaceous crops are two of the crop families most
frequently cultivated worldwide that are severely affected by RKN.
Regarding cucurbit crops, maximum yield losses of 88, 53 and 35% in
cucumber, zucchini and watermelon, respectively, have been estimated
under greenhouse conditions [@Gine2014a; @Vela2014;
@Lopez-Gomez2014a, 2015]. RKN are also one of the most
damaging soilborne pathogens for solanaceous crops, specially under
protected cultivation, with maximum yield losses of 94, 95 and 100%
reported for pepper, eggplant and tomato, respectively [@Gine2017c;
@Hallmann2018a].

Population dynamics and yield losses {#population-dynamics-and-yield-losses .unnumbered}
------------------------------------

Population dynamics studies the factors that determine the temporal
oscillation of densities of individuals from the same specie living in a
certain area. The nematode population density at sowing or transplanting
of a crop is related with its productivity. The proper modeling of
population dynamics allows to estimate the densities variability over
time in relation with influencing factors, and therefore, to relate them
with the yield losses that nematodes could cause. Modeling the damage
levels enable to calculate parameters such the tolerance limit (*T*),
the maximum population density above which yield losses start to occur,
and the maximum yield losses (*m*). These parameters, along with the
maximum reproduction rate (*a*)(*Pf/Pi* at low densities
[@Ferris1985], and the equilibrium density, that initial population at
which nematode receive just enough supply of nutrients to maintain the
population density at the same level from begin at the end of the
growing season; permits to evaluate the importance of a determined
nematode from a growing area, or the effect of management strategies.
These quantitative studies constitute the basis for populations'
evolution understanding of specific patosystems with typical
agro-environmental conditions from determine growing area, and to design
and implement effective and durable management strategies (Sorriba and
Verdejo-Lucas 2011; Fig
[2](#fig:FigPivsPf){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:FigPivsPf"}).



```{r FigPivsPf, fig.cap="Relation between initial and final densities in experiments with a nematode on a good host, intermediate hosts, poor hosts, and a nonhost. *Pi* and *Pf*: initial and final densities on logarithmic scales. Equilibrium density: *Pf = Pi* (adapted from @Seinhorst1970a).", echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%"}

```

Population density fluctuations are affected by denso-independent and
denso-dependent factors. Denso-independent factors, such climate,
environmental conditions, and intraspecific competition, influence from
outside of population, while denso-dependent include interspecific
competition and the action of antagonist or predators. Two phases can be
distinguish: one during the host plant cultivation in which nematode
have enough nutrients to increase its population density, and the second
during either no cropping periods in which there is no food supply and
population density do not increase, or decrease depending on the
nematode and the duration of periods with no host cultivation.

The multiplication growth rate (*Pf*/*Pi*), that is, the relationship
between the nematode population density at transplanting (*Pi*) and at
the end of the crop (*Pf*) is consider a good indicator of population
growth. In absence of competition between individuals for limiting
resources, the *Pf*/*Pi* maximize (*a*), and the relationship with *Pi*
its a straight line (*Pf* = *aPi*; thus *Pf*/*Pi* = *a*). However,
increases in *Pi* induce competition between individuals for healthy
plant tissue, can induce alteration in sex differentiation or to reduce
in female fecundity, thus *Pf*/*Pi* decreases. In the case of nematodes
that reproduce parthenogenetically, such *Meloidogyne* spp., the
relationship between *Pf*/*Pi* and *Pi* follows an inverse potential
function (*Pf*/*Pi* = *aPi*^-b^, where *a* is the maximum multiplication
rate, and *-b* is the decrease rate of the population as *Pi* increase).
The maximum multiplication rate (*a*) is a good indicator of the plant
host status to Meloidogyne. Higher values of *a* indicate that the plant
is a good host and low values, a pooor host [@Ferris1985].

The population growth rate can also be useful to estimate the *Pi* at
which *Pf*/*Pi* = 1, the equilibrium density (*E*). This can be
calculated from the regression equation obtained from linearizing the
relationship between the *Pi* and the multiplication rate (*Pf/Pi*). The
population growth rate is also a useful indicator that allows to compare
between plant species and/or germplasms, as well as the effectiveness of
control methods [@Talavera2009b; @Gine2017b; @Exposito2018c]; Fig
[3](#fig:LogPivsLogPfPi3){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:LogPivsLogPfPi3"}).


```{r LogPivsLogPfPi3, fig.cap="Relation between initial population density (*Pi*) and multiplication rate (*Pf/Pi*) of RKN on two hypothetical germplasms (adapted from @Ferris1985).", echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3fJzp2yIYOvKBgotoDzZ8fzIE6DZh8M_ZO6HKWyIeAstNe-z5QyVtbxTMs8Gt9773vi9G1LUI4tOEl-LNW-FwFGNBu5G7s-Fl-pyqkEjk6aJ7Nws0AF1yybBA-xsaeUE_Zjtg-FctOLeidpTFwOBx0=w1095-h868-no?authuser=3")
```



Regarding to crop yield losses, there are two parameters that can be
calculated by estimating the relationship between increasing levels of
*Pi* and the relative crop biomass or yield according to the Seinhort's
damage model [@fdi:010017629]:

The nematode population density above which yield loss start to occur is
defined as the nematode damage threshold level or the tolerance limit of
the crop (*T*). This value, along with the the minimum relative yield
(*m*) are important parameters to characterize the response of a crop
plant to a nematode population. The parameter *T* manifests itself at
small nematode densities and *m* at larger ones [@Greco2009a]; Fig
[4](#fig:Seinhorst){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:Seinhorst"}).

Plant resistance {#plant-resistance .unnumbered}
----------------

The most commonly used strategy for RKN management has been, until
recent years, the use of fumigant and non fumigant nematicides
[@Nyczepir2009a]. However, regulations such the European directive
2009/128/EC and the U.S. Clean Air Act [@U.S.2012]), have brought
special attention on the research and development of environmentally
friendlier management strategies. A promising alternative strategy
involves the use of resistant plants, those whose have the ability to
suppress infection development, and/or reproduction of plant-parasitic
nematodes [@Roberts2009]. Plant resistance has proven to be effective
and economically profitable [@Sorribas2005a], and also reduce yield
losses of the follwing crop [@OrnatC1997a; @Talavera2009b;
@Westphal2011; @Thies2015; @Gine2017b; @ExpositoA.2019c].

The resistance levels of a determined plant germplasm can be categorized
in relation to a susceptible standard [@Hadisoeganda1982c]. Expressed
as the percentage of RKN reproduction compared to that in a susceptible
standard, this parameter is called the reproduction index (RI; Fig
[5](#fig:RI3){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:RI3"}).



```{r RI3, fig.cap="A diagrammatic representation of the continuum of susceptibility and resistance to nematode reproduction within a crop germplasm pool (adapted from @starr2009a).", echo=FALSE, out.width = "90%"}

```



Despite its advantages, the expression of plant resistance can be
affected by several factors, such the genetic background of the plant
cultivar and/or the nematode species or population [@Cortada2008]. The
selection of virulent nematode populations due to repeated cultivation
of the same resistance gene [@Verdejo-Lucas2009a; @Gine2017b;
@ExpositoA.2019c]. Moreover, there are only a few resistance genes
introgressed into commercial solanaceous cultivars at present, and none
in cucurbits. That are, the *Me1, Me3* and *N* gene in pepper, and the
*Mi1.2* gene in tomato. Soil temeprature can also affect the expression
of plant resistance. It is known that the *Mi1.2* gene is affected at
soil temperatures above 30 °C, while the resistance of the *N* gene is
reported to be partially lost at 32 °C [@araujo1982effects;
@Thies1998]. Thus,plant resistance is a valuable management tool but
it should be used in a proper manner to maximize its effectiveness.
Moreover, more research are needed to identify new resistance sources
for increasing the *R*-genes that could be used in rotation schemes .

Grafting vegetables onto resistant rootstocks is an effective method to
control soilborne pathogens when no commercial cultivars are available
[@Miguel2004a; @Cohen2007; @Thies2016; @Kumar2018]. This control
method was essentially rediscovered in the past two decades and quickly
expanded to become a common practice at the present [@Thies2015c;
@Kyriacou2017]. Grafting has expanded mainly in the Cucurbitaceae and
the Solanaceae families [@Moncada2013]. The use of anatomical and
physiological compatible graft combinations improve the plant
performance under biotic or abiotic stress conditions when compared with
that of the ungrafted scion, allowing rapid response to new pathogen
races without the prolonged screening and selection required for
breeding resistance into cultivars [@Davis2008]. Although the
tolerance and resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses, respectively,
along with an increasing productivity have been the main drivers of
rootstock selection and breeding, the effect of grafting on fruit
quality is also another important factor to take into account
[@Kyriacou2017].

Some strategies proposed to avoid the selection for RKN virulence or to
reduce the level of virulence and crop yield losses consider to include
resistant and susceptible crops in rotation sequences
[@Talavera2009b], the use of crops of two different resistant plant
species [@ExpositoA.2019c], or to pyramid different *R*-genes
[@Djian2014]. However, as literature reviewed points out, most of the
research done have been focusing on tomato and pepper. Thus, the aim of
this thesis was to increase the diversity of resistance sources against
RKN by potentially effective rootstocks for two species of the most
economically important botanical families cultivated, the cucurbitaseous
watermelon (*Citrullus lanatus* var. *lanatus*), and the solanaseous
eggplant (*Solanum melongena*). A brief description of these two crops
and their potential rootstocks is presented in the next two sections.


Watermelon {#watermelon .unnumbered}
----------

### Importance {#importance .unnumbered}

Watermelon is the most cultivated cucurbit crop worldwide. The global
production in 2017 was ca. 118 million t in ca. 3.4 million ha, 38% of
the arable land destined to cultivate for this botanical family, with an
estimated value of 48.9B [@FAOSTAT2017c]; Fig
[6](#fig:WorldWatermelon02){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:WorldWatermelon02"}). In spite of its origin theorized in the
African continent, most of the watermelon are produced in Asia, with 67%
of total world production in China. Within the European Union (EU),
Spain was the main watermelon producer during 2017, with 20,026 ha
harvested to produce 1.1 million t of fruit marketed with an estimated
value of 331M, 68% of which were exported [@MAPA2019]. The watermelon
fruit composition is 93% water, with small amounts of protein, fat,
minerals, and vitamins. The major nutritional fruit components are
carbohydrates (6.4 g/100 g), vitamin A (590 IU), and lycopene (4,100
μg/100g, range 2300--7200), an anticarcinogenic compound found in
red flesh watermelon, even in higher amounts than in tomato, pink
grapefruit, or guava [@Wehner2008].

```


### Origin {#origin .unnumbered}

Watermelon is a diploid creeping monoecious crop that belongs to the
*Cucurbitaceae* family. The taxonomy of the genus *Citrullus* have had
major misapplication of names until recent years, including that of
watermelon, *C. lanatus*, itself [@Chomicki2015]; [@Renner2014]. The
Southern African region is reported to be the center of diversity and
probably the center of origin of most of the *Citrullus* species
[@Dane2004; @Rubatsky2001; @Robinson1997]. However, four
hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of watermelon: i) that it
descends from the northern African colocynth (*C. colocynthis*,
[@Singh1978; @Sain2002; @McCreight2013]. ii) That it derives from
the South African citron melon, *C. amarus*, previously referred as *C.
lanatus* var. *citroides* [@Robinson1997; @Maynard2000;
@Rubatsky2001; @Chomicki2015]. iii) That it stems from the West
African *C. mucosospermus* [@Guo2013; @Chomicki2015], and iv) Recent
research with polygenomic analyses of nuclear gene sequences suggest
that the white-fleshed Sudanese Kordophan melon (*Citrullus vulgaris*)
is the closest relative of domesticated watermelon that was originated
and domesticated in north-eastern Africa [@Renner2019]; Fig
[6](#fig:WorldWatermelon02){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:WorldWatermelon02"}).

### Cultivation challenges {#cultivation-challenges .unnumbered}

The modern cultivated watermelon has a narrow genetic base
[@Szamosi2009; @Solmaz2010; @Nimmakayala2014] attributed to many
years of domestication and selection of its desirable horticultural
traits such as red-scarlet flesh color and sweetness [@Levi2001b;
@Hwang2011; @Lambel2014; @Nimmakayala2014]. The continued use of
cultivars with narrow genetic base for breeding resulted in reduced gene
diversity among American watermelon accessions [@Wang2015;
@Zhang2016]. This has derived in susceptibility of crops to random and
emerging biotic and abiotic stresses [@Levi2001a; @Mo2016]. In spite
of being consider a less suitable host for RKN than other cucurbit
crops, watermelon maximum yield losses of 37% have been recently
reported in Spain [@Lopez-Gomez2014a]. Moreover, as the next section
will better describe, modern watermelons are commonly grafted onto
commercial rootstocks owing its resistance to fusarium, however, these
rootstocks are not resistant to *Meloidogyne*
[@Kokalis-Burelle2011; @Lopez-Gomez2016; @Gine2017c].

### Grafting {#grafting .unnumbered}

A detailed history of cucurbit grafting have been done by Davis
[-@Davis2008]. The primary motive for grafting cucurbits is to avoid
damage caused by soilborne pests and pathogens when genetic or chemical
approaches for disease management are not available [@Oda2002].
Research on cucurbit grafting began in the 1920s with the use of
*Cucurbita moschata* as a rootstock for watermelon, but then bottle
gourd (*Lagenaria siceraria*) soon became the preferred rootstock. By
the year 1998, approximately 95% of watermelon and oriental melons were
grafted onto squash or bottlegourd rootstocks in Japan, Korea, and
Taiwan [@Oda2003]. Possibly because of the widespread use of bottle
gourd rootstocks, there are reports of plants affected by Fusarium wilt,
probably the most common and damaging soilborne disease of cucurbit
crops worldwide, caused by *Fusarium oxysporum* Schltdl. Moreover both
rootstocks are susceptible to *Meloidogyne* infection
[@Kokalis-Burelle2011; @Lopez-Gomez2016; @Gine2017c]. Hence, an
alternative genetic source of resistance to both pathogens must be found
and properly characterized in order to be able to design an effective
and widely applicable RKN management strategy.

A potential alternative rootstock for watermelon, is its close relative
citron or preserving melon, *C. amarus*. The flesh of the citron is
white or green, and may vary from bland to bitter tasting. Its rind is
used to make pickles, and the fruit are feeding to livestock
[@Wehner2008]. Conversely to watermelon, citron melon exhibits wider
genetic variation [@Levi2001b] suggesting its genetic worthiness as a
source of valuable genes for breeding [@Ngwepe2019]. This rootstock
have show to be resistant to several soil pathogens such as fusarium
wilt, gummy stem blight, powdery mildew, potyviruses, and some species
and populations of *Meloidogyne* [@Gusmini2005; @Huitron2007a;
@Guner2008; @Tetteh2010; @Thies2016]. In spite of it, there is
little information about it use to control RKN in the EU, thus, research
on its response to local population must be done before include it in a
management strategy.

Eggplant {#eggplant .unnumbered}
--------

### Importance {#importance-1 .unnumbered}

Eggplant, *Solanum melongena*, is the third most widely cultivated
Solanaceous fruiting crop after potato and tomato. The global production
in 2017 was ca. 52 million t in ca. 1.8 million ha, 7% of the arable
land destined to cultivate for this family, with an estimated value of
36.2B. Most of eggplants production is made in China and India, with ca.
87% of global production done there in 2017. Italy, Spain and Romania
were the top three eggplant producer countries in the EU, with 286,473,
225,912 and 124,429 t produced, respectively (@FAOSTAT2017c; Fig
[7](#fig:WorldEggplant02){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:WorldEggplant02"}). Eggplant is not high in the majority of
health-related micronutrients, but it is very low in fat an calorie and
a rich source of nutritionally and pharmaceutically useful compounds,
such a number phytonutrients, especially hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA)
conjugates, potentially involved in consumer health, fruit taste and
texture [@Meyer2015; @Chapman2019].

### Origin {#origin-1 .unnumbered}

The Asian eggplant is a widely grown species from the *Solanaceae*
family. Eggplant is especially popular in the Southeast Asia and the
Mediterranean region . Several non-exclusive theories have been proposed
regarding eggplant's origin. The general consensus [@Weese2010;
@Knapp2013] is that the African/Middle Eastern species *S. incanum*
was transported into Indo-China where the true wild progenitor, *S.
insanum*, evolved, from which *S. melongena* is derived
[@Chapman2019].

### Cultivation challenges {#cultivation-challenges-1 .unnumbered}

The commercial eggplant cultivars also have a narrow genetic diversity
that, is even poorer than for other solanaceous crops such as tomato and
pepper. A list of eggplant diseases and pests, and resistances described
has been well summarized by Daunay [-@Daunay2008]. Among the most
common soil borne diseases affecting eggplants are bacterial, fusarium
and verticillium wilt, caused by *Ralstonia solanacearum*, *Fusarium
oxysporum* f. sp. *melongenae*, *Verticillium dahliae* and *V.
albo-atrum*. Moreover, it is also susceptible to RKN.

### Grafting {#grafting-1 .unnumbered}

Eggplant grafting is mostly used in intensive production conditions. As
Daunay [-@Daunay2008] well summarize, there are currently three types
of eggplant rootstock: i) *S. melongena* lines and hybrids that resist
to Fusarium and bacterial wilt, and Phomopsis blight, ii) rootstocks
based on the use of *S. integrifolium*, which also resists to Fusarium
and bacterial wilts, and is used directly as a rootstock or as parent
crossed with *S. melongena* varieties for producing interspecific hybrid
rootstocks (*S. integrifolium × S. melongena*), and iii) the
third type of rootstocks is composed by *Solanum* species such *S.
torvum* and *S. sanitswongsei*. However, within Europe eggplant is
grafted mostly onto tomato or tomato interspecific hybrids (*L.
esculentum × L. hirsutum*).

*Solanum torvum* is a wild relative of eggplant that is resistant to *V.
dahliae*, *R. solanacearum*, *F. oxysporum* f. sp. *Melongenae*, and
some RKN populations [@Singh1997; @Bletsos2003; @Daunay2008;
@Gisbert2011]. Although resistance of *S. torvum* rootstocks to *M.
incognita* have been consistently described against several populations
from France [@Daunay1985], India [@Shetty1985; @Dhivya2014b],
Japan [@Hara1983; @Ali1992], Pakistan [@Rahman2002a] and Turkey
[@Curuk2009]; several studies found discrepancies on the levels of
resistance to *M. arenaria* [@Daunay1985; Gonzalez et al 2010; Ryu et
al. 2011; @Uehara2017b; @Ocal2018a] and *M. javanica*
[@Daunay1985; @Boiteux1996; @Tzortzakakis2006a; @Ocal2018a]. As
far as literature reviewed pointed out, there are no enough studies that
widely characterize the response of *S. torvum* against *Meloidogyne*
populations occurring in Spain.

Most of grafting application have expanded mainly in the *Cucurbitaceae*
and *Solanaceae* family, both major vegetable crops that are commonly
rotated to maximize land use and boost productivity
[@Lopez-Gomez2015a; @Kyriacou2017]. The proper screening of *C.
amarus* and *S. torvum* rootstocks could give crucial information about
potential tools already available to design effective and
environmentally friendlier strategies to managing RKN. In particular,
this work will focus on *Meloidogyne* populations ocurrying in Spain,
some of them previously described as virulents to the Mi1.2 gene in
tomato [@Ornat2007; @Verdejo-Lucas2012].

Objectives {#objectives .unnumbered}
----------

The main objective of this thesis was to determine the durability of
resistance to *Meloidogyne* of *Citrullus amarus* and *Solanum torvum*
as potential rootstocks for watermelon and eggplant, respectively. This
objective was divided into specific objectives to determine:

1.  The response of two *Citrullus amarus* accessions, BGV0005164 and
    BGV0005167, against different *Meloidogyne arenaria*, *M.
    incognita*, and *M. javanica* (a)virulent isolates in pot
    experiments and against *M. incognita* in plastic greenhouse
    (Chapter 1).

2.  The performance of ungrafted and grafted watermelon onto *C. amarus*
    accessions submitted to increasing densities of *M. incognita* and
    *M. javanica* in pot experiments to determine the maximum
    multiplication rate, the maximum population density and the
    equilibrium density of the root-knot nematode species and the effect
    on shoot dry biomass of watermelon (Chapter 2).

3.  The durability of resistance of *C. amarus* accessions after two
    consecutive years in the same plots, the selection for virulence and
    the fitness cost for the nematode (Chapter 2).

4.  The response of commercial *Solanum torvum* cultivars against
    (a)virulent isolates of *M. incognita* and *M. javanica* in pot
    experiments and against *M. incognita* in plastic greenhouse in two
    cropping seasons (Chapter 3).

5.  The performance of ungrafted and grafted eggplant onto *S. torvum*
    'Brutus' submitted to increasing densities of *M. javanica* in pot
    experiments to determine the maximum multiplication rate, the
    maximum population density and the equilibrium density of the
    root-knot nematode species and the effect on shoot dry biomass of
    watermelon (Chapter 3).

6.  The durability of resistance of *S. torvum* 'Brutus' after two
    consecutive years in the same plots, the selection for virulence and
    the fitness cost for the nematode (Chapter 4).
