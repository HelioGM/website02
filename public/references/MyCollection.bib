abstract = {BACKGROUND: Solanum torvum Sw is worldwide employed as rootstock for eggplant cultivation because of its vigour and resistance/tolerance to the most serious soil-borne diseases as bacterial, fungal wilts and root-knot nematodes. The little information on Solanum torvum (hereafter Torvum) resistance mechanisms, is mostly attributable to the lack of genomic tools (e.g. dedicated microarray) as well as to the paucity of database information limiting high-throughput expression studies in Torvum.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: As a first step towards transcriptome profiling of Torvum inoculated with the nematode M. incognita, we built a Torvum 3' transcript catalogue. One-quarter of a 454 full run resulted in 205,591 quality-filtered reads. De novo assembly yielded 24,922 contigs and 11,875 singletons. Similarity searches of the S. torvum transcript tags catalogue produced 12,344 annotations. A 30,0000 features custom combimatrix chip was then designed and microarray hybridizations were conducted for both control and 14 dpi (day post inoculation) with Meloidogyne incognita-infected roots samples resulting in 390 differentially expressed genes (DEG). We also tested the chip with samples from the phylogenetically-related nematode-susceptible eggplant species Solanum melongena. An in-silico validation strategy was developed based on assessment of sequence similarity among Torvum probes and eggplant expressed sequences available in public repositories. GO term enrichment analyses with the 390 Torvum DEG revealed enhancement of several processes as chitin catabolism and sesquiterpenoids biosynthesis, while no GO term enrichment was found with eggplant DEG.The genes identified from S. torvum catalogue, bearing high similarity to known nematode resistance genes, were further investigated in view of their potential role in the nematode resistance mechanism.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: By combining 454 pyrosequencing and microarray technology we were able to conduct a cost-effective global transcriptome profiling in a non-model species. In addition, the development of an in silico validation strategy allowed to further extend the use of the custom chip to a related species and to assess by comparison the expression of selected genes without major concerns of artifacts. The expression profiling of S. torvum responses to nematode infection points to sesquiterpenoids and chitinases as major effectors of nematode resistance. The availability of the long sequence tags in S. torvum catalogue will allow precise identification of active nematocide/nematostatic compounds and associated enzymes posing the basis for exploitation of these resistance mechanisms in other species.},

abstract = {Selection in plant parasites for virulence on resistant hosts and the resulting effects on parasite fitness may be considered as a driving force in host-parasite coevolution. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that a fitness cost may be associated with nematode virulence, using the interaction between the parthenogenetic species Meloidogyne incognita and tomato as a model system. The reproductive parameters of near-isogenic lines of the nematode, selected for avirulence or virulence against the tomato Mi resistance gene, were analysed and combined into a reproductive index that was taken as a measure of fitness. The lower fitness of the virulent lines on the susceptible tomato cultivar showed for the first time that a measurable fitness cost is associated with unnecessary virulence in the nematode. Although parthenogenesis should theoretically lead to little genetic variability, such cost may impose a direct constraint on the coevolution between the plant and the nematode populations, and suggests an adaptive significance of trade-offs between selected characters and fitness-related traits. These results indicate that, although plant resistance can be broken, it might prove durable in some conditions if the virulent nematodes are counterselected in susceptible plants, which could have important consequences for the management of resistant cultivars in the field.},

annote = {The Asian eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), is a widely grown species from the Solanaceae family. As Chapman (2019) stated, â€œseveral non-exclusive theories have been proposed concerning the origin of eggplant. The general consensus (Knapp et al., 2013; Weese and Bohs, 2010) is that the African/Middle Eastern species S. incanum L. was transported, intentionally or otherwise, into Indo-China where the true wild progenitor, S. insanum L., evolved, from which S. melongena is derived. 
 Eggplant is the third most widely grown Solanaceous vegetable after potato and tomato. Eggplant is especially popular in cousins of Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean. In 2016, the area of potato and tomato harvested worldwide was greater than that of eggplant by a factor of 10 and three, respectively (FAO, 2017). Whilst eggplant is not known for being high in the majority of health-related micronutrients, it is very low fat and low calorie. 
Solanum torvum is an eggplant crop wild relative (CWR) and is often used as a rootstock because of strong resistance to several soil-borne pathogens, notably the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Gousset et al., 2015). In order to understand more about the genes involved in root-knot nematode resistance, gene expression analysis was carried out on S. torvum plants with and without infection (Bagnaresi et al., 2013), revealing almost 400 genes which were differentially expressed under pathogen infection. Gene ontology analysis showed that many of these genes were related to known pathogen response genes, especially chitinases which are often upregulated in plants exposed to nematode infection (e.g. Qtu et al., 1997).},

abstract = {Type specimens are permanently preserved biological specimens that fix the usage of species names. This method became widespread from 1935 onwards and is now obligatory. We used DNA sequencing of types and more recent collections of wild and cultivated melons to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the genus Citrullus and the correct names for its species. We discovered that the type specimen of the name Citrullus lanatus, prepared by a Linnaean collector in South Africa in 1773, is not the species now thought of as watermelon. Instead, it is a representative of another species that is sister to C. ecirrhosus, a tendril-less South African endemic. The closest relative of the watermelon instead is a West African species. Our nuclear and plastid data furthermore reveal that there are seven species of Citrullus, not four as assumed. Our study implies that sweet watermelon originates from West, not southern Africa as previously believed, and that the South African citron melon has been independently domesticated. These findings affect and explain numerous studies on the origin of these two crops that led to contradictory results because of the erroneous merging of several distinct species.},

Soil infestation decreased yield, plant height, final above-ground biomass, and also reduced fruit mean weight and shoot dry weight depending on cultivar or grafting. Grafting decreased fruit oxalic acid and the soluble solid contents, and increased mean fruit weight, depending on cultivar and soil infestation. Grafting also reduced the negative effects of the pathogens on disease index, plant height and shoot dry weight. Cultivar Pala was more vigorous than Faselis, and S. torvum was a vigorous rootstock. The combination of a vigorous rootstock with a weak cultivar (Faselis) is more profitable than that of a vigorous rootstock and a vigorous cultivar (Pala). Using S. torvum as a rootstock for cultivar Faselis, grown in soil infested with the pathogens, is most likely to be useful in conventional and low-input sustainable horticulture, since grafting increases protection against the pathogens, and reduces the losses in quality and yield.},

Natural resistance ( R ) genes offer an alternative to chemical control and have been shown effectively to limit nematode damage to crops in the field. Whilst a number of resistant cultivars have conferred resistance against root-knot and cyst nematodes for many decades, an increasing number of reports of resistance-breaking nematode pathotypes are beginning to emerge. The forces affecting the emergence of virulent nematodes are complex, multifactorial and involve both the host and parasite of the plant-nematode interaction. This review provides an overview of the root-knot and cyst nematode R genes characterised to date, in addition to examining the evolutionary forces influencing nematode populations and the emergence of virulence. Finally, potential strategies to improve R gene durability in the field are outlined, and areas that would benefit from further research efforts are highlighted.},

abstract = {Due to limited availability of arable land and high market demand for off-season vegetables, cucurbits (plants in the family Cucurbitaceae) are continuously cultivated under unfavorable conditions in some countries. These conditions include environments that are too cold, wet, or dry, or are cool low-light winter greenhouses. Successive cropping can increase salinity, the incidence of cucurbit pests, and soilborne diseases like fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium spp. These conditions cause various physiological and pathological disorders leading to severe crop loss. Chemical pest control is expensive, not always effective, and can harm the environment. Grafting can overcome many of these problems. In fact, in many parts of the world, grafting is a routine technique in continuous cropping systems. It was first commonly used in Japan during the late 1920s by grafting watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. and Nakai] onto pumpkin [Cucurbita moschata Duchesne ex. Poir] rootstocks. Soon after, watermelons were grafted onto bottle gourd [Lagenaria siceraria (Molina) Standl.] rootstocks. This practice helped control declining yield due to soilborne diseases. China produces more than half the world's watermelons and cucumbers (Cucumis sativus L.), and approximately 20{\%} of these are grafted. Use of rootstocks can enhance plant vigor through vigorous attainment of soil nutrients, avoidance of soil pathogens and tolerance of low soil temperatures, salinity, and wet-soil conditions. The type of rootstock affects cucurbit plant growth, yield, and fruit quality. Cucurbit grafting is rare in the United States, but with continued loss of quality disease-free farmland along with the phase-out of methyl bromide, the U.S. cucurbit industry sees grafting as an attractive option. Some seed companies now offer watermelon transplants grafted onto squash or bottle gourd rootstocks, and some transplant facilities offer grafting services. There have been thorough analyses of cucurbit grafting in other countries, but the literature in English is limited. This review summarizes the state of the cucurbit grafting industry on a global level, translating work published in many languages. Copyright {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The emergence of virulent root-knot nematode populations, able to overcome the resistance conferred by some of the resistance genes (R-genes) in Solanaceous crops, i.e., Mi(s) in tomato, Me(s) in pepper, may constitute a severe limitation to their use in the field. Research has been conducted to evaluate the durability of these R-genes, by comparing the reproduction of several laboratory-selected and wild virulent Meloidogyne incognita isolates, on both susceptible and resistant tomatoes and peppers. We first show that the Me1 R-gene in pepper behaves as a robust R-gene controlling avirulent and virulent Me3, Me7 or Mi-1 isolates. Although the reproductive potential of the virulent isolates was highly variable on susceptible and resistant plants, we also confirm that virulence is highly specific to a determined R-gene on which selection has occurred. Another significant experimental result is the observation that a reproductive fitness cost is associated with nematode virulence against Mi-1 in tomato and Me3 and Me7 in pepper. The adaptative significance of trade-offs between selected characters and fitness-related traits, suggests that, although the resistance can be broken, it may be preserved in some conditions if the virulent nematodes are counter-selected in susceptible plants. All these results have important consequences for the management of plant resistance in the field. {\textcopyright} 2011 KNPV.},

For each crop, soil nematode densities, galling index, number of eggs per plant and crop yield were determined. Virulence selection was evaluated in pot experiments. RESULTS: In the tomatoâ€“melon rotation, nematode densities increased progressively for the grafted tomato, being higher than for ungrafted plants at the end of the study; this was not the case in the melonâ€“tomato rotation. Grafted crops yielded more than ungrafted crops in the infested plots. Virulence against the Mi1.2 gene was detected, but not against C. metuliferus. Reproduction of M. incognita on the resistant tomato was âˆ¼ 120{\%} that on the susceptible cultivar after the first grafted tomato crop, but this decreased to just 25{\%} at the end of the experiment.

The number of egg masses and number of eggs per plant were assessed, and the reproduction index (RI) was calculated as the percentage of eggs produced on the C. metuliferus accessions compared to those produced on the susceptible cultivars. The compatibility and fruit quality were assessed by grafting three scions, two of Charentais type and one of type piel de sapo, under commercial greenhouse conditions. The resistance level of both C. metuliferus accessions ranged from highly resistant (RI {\textless} 1{\%}) to resistant (1{\%} â‰¤ RI â‰¤ 10{\%}) irrespective of Meloidogyne isolates. Melon plants grafted onto C. metuliferus accession BGV11135 grew as self-grafted plants without negatively impacting fruit quality traits. Giant cells induced by Meloidogyne spp. on C. metuliferus were in general poorly developed compared to those on cucumber. Furthermore, necrotic areas surrounding the nematode were observed.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.BACKGROUND: The grafting of watermelons (Citrullus lanatus) is a common technique that increases yield under stressful soil conditions. The most common rootstocks for watermelons are Cucurbita hybrids. However, they often have a negative impact on fruit quality. Exploiting novel Citrullus germplasm such as citron melon (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides) is an alternative to avoid these quality problems. RESULTS: Citron melon has been validated as watermelon rootstock, comparing its effects on watermelon quality to those of Cucurbita hybrids. Larger fruits with thicker rinds were observed in fruits from plants grafted onto both citron and Cucurbita rootstocks. The citron melon had no significant effect on flesh sugars or acid profiles compared to non-grafted watermelons, except for an increase in glucose and malic acid content, which also occurred in the Cucurbita rootstocks. The aroma profile of fruits produced on citron melon was similar to that of the non-grafted and self-grafted controls. The citron rootstock did not display the increased levels of (Z)-6-nonen-1-ol (a compound associated with pumpkin-like odors) found in fruits produced with Cucurbita hybrids. CONCLUSION: The low impact of citron melon rootstock on fruit quality, along with the enhanced resistance against nematodes, make the citron a promising alternative to Cucurbita rootstocks.},

@article{Gaion2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC. Grafting is a method employed to improve crop production. The first grafted vegetable seedlings used were for Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus L.) plants grafted onto Lagenaria siceraria L. rootstock to overcome Fusarium wilt. Since then, the use of grafted solanaceous and cucurbitaceous seedlings has spread, with the practice mainly used in Asia, Europe, and North America. The expansion of grafting is likely due to its ability to provide tolerance to biotic stress, such as soilborne pathogens, and to abiotic stresses, such as cold, salinity, drought, and heavy metal toxicity, due to the resistance found in the rootstock. Many aspects related to rootstock/scion interactions are poorly understood, which can cause loss of fruit quality, reduced production, shorter postharvest time, and, most commonly, incompatibility between rootstock and scion. The rootstock and scion cultivars must be chosen with care to avoid loss. This review discusses the possible loss, damage, and potential contribution of grafting and future perspectives of this technique toward improvement of vegetable production.},

The experiment was established in field conditions in two types of soil of the region: lithosol of medium texture and lithosol of medium texture with a tendency to compaction. Two varieties of hard wheat (Triticum durum L.), Imperial F2008 and Cirno C2008, and two varieties of flour wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), Tacupeto F2001 and Norman F2008, were evaluated. The experimental design was randomized blocks with four treatments and four replications: control (with no application), 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 t ha-1 compost. The variables were total chlorophyll, photosynthesis, agronomic yield components and concentration of nutrients. There was significant response to incorporation of compost: total chlorophyll increased almost 15 {\%}, photosynthesis 15 {\%}, and yield nearly 10 {\%}; the concentration of nitrogen, calcium and magnesium doubled and phosphorus increased four times. In general, nutrient requirements of the hard and flour wheat varieties were fullfilled, and the response, reflected in the assessed variables, was better in the compost treatments. Application of 5.0 t ha-1 compost increased average wheat yield by 20 {\%}.},

The influence of the squash hybrid RS841 rootstock (Cucurbita maxima x C. moschata) on population dynamics of Meloidogyne incognita and yield of cucumber cv. Dasher II was assessed during 2013 and 2014 in a plastic greenhouse. In addition, the relationship between ecophysiological parameters (plant water status, gas exchange, and leaf reflectance) and Pi and cucumber yield were also estimated in 2013. Nematode densities were determined at the beginning (Pi) and at the end (Pf) of each crop, and the relationship between these parameters was used to estimate the maximum multiplication rate (a), the maximum population density (M) and the equilibrium density (E) per grafted and ungrafted cucumber and cropping season. Moreover, the relationship between the multiplication rate (Pf/Pi) and Pi was compared between grafted and ungrafted cucumber per cropping season. Finally, the relative yield of grafted or ungrafted cucumber was plotted against Pi to determine the tolerance limit (T) and the minimum relative yield (m) by the Seinhorst damage function model. Values of a, M and E in grafted cucumber were higher than in ungrafted one irrespective of the cropping season. These results were supported by comparing the relationship between Pf/Pi and Pi between grafted and ungrafted cucumber. The relationship between Pi and yield fitted the Seinhorst damage function. The values of T and m did not differ between grafted and ungrafted each year. Predawn water potential, net photosynthetic rate, and leaf chlorophyll index decreased with increasing Pi. In addition, relative yield was related to variation in net photosynthetic rate and the leaf chlorophyll index. Under the conditions of this study, RS841 rootstock was neither resistant nor tolerant to M. incognita.},

Additionally, the enzymatic activity of the fungus, the percentage of fungal egg and juvenile parasitism, cardinal temperatures and the effect of water potential on mycelial growth and the soil receptivity to Pl251 were determined in vitro. RESULTS: Plant resistance was the only factor that suppressed nematode and crop yield losses. Percentage of egg parasitism in plots treated with BioAct WG was less than 2.6{\%}. However, under in vitro conditions, Pl251 showed protease, lipase and chitinase activities and parasitised 94.5{\%} of eggs, but no juveniles. Cardinal temperatures were 14.2, 24â€“26 and 35.4 Â°C. The maximum Pl251 mycelial growth was at âˆ’0.25 MPa and 25 Â°C. Soil temperatures and water potential in the greenhouse were in the range of the fungus. However, soil receptivity was lower in greenhouse soil, irrespective of sterilisation, than in sterilised sand. CONCLUSION: Plant resistance was the only factor able to suppress nematode densities, disease severity and yield losses, and to protect the following cucumber crop.

abstract = {Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. {\&}{\#}38; Nakai) is a major crop in the southern United States. Papaya ringspot virus-watermelon strain (PRSV-W, formerly Watermelon mosaic virus-1) and Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) affect all agricultural species of the Cucurbitaceae and are of great economic importance because of their destructiveness. Watermelon has not been screened extensively for resistance to PRSV-W. Although there is a resistance source for ZYMV resistance, the identification of additional sources of resistance to ZYMV would be highly desirable since the initial sources of resistance are temperature dependent, or not resistant to some of the more severe strains of the virus. The objectives of this study were 1) to screen the USDA watermelon germplasm collection along with available watermelon cultivars for PRSV-W resistance; 2) to verify the disease rating for the most resistant and most susceptible accessions; 3) to determine the genetic control of PRSV-W resistance; and 4) to screen the U.S.D.A. watermelon germplasm collection along with available watermelon cultivars to identify additional sources of resistance to ZYMV. A total of 1275 plant introduction accessions and 44 watermelon cultivars were screened for PRSV-W resistance. The experiment was a randomized complete block with five replications. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed after the last rating to determine whether the virus was in the plant tissue. After the germplasm screening, the most resistant and most susceptible cultigens were retested to verify their reactions. Of the 60 resistant PI accessions in the final retest, eight had resistance with a rating of 3.6 or less for the best, average and maximum ratings: PI 244017, PI 244019, PI 482342, PI 482318, PI 485583, PI 482379, PI 595203, and PI 244018. None of the watermelon cultivars tested exhibited resistance to PRSV-W. Inheritance of PRSV-W resistance was studied in three C. lanatus var. citroides accessions: PI 244017, PI 244019, and PI 485583. Three susceptible parent lines, 'Allsweet', 'Calhoun Gray', and 'New Hampshire Midget', were crossed with resistant accessions to develop F1, F2, and BC1 generations for six families. A single recessive gene was found to control resistance to PRSV-W in all three resistant PI accessions. A test of allelism indicated that resistance to PRSV-W in the three PI accessions was due to the same gene. Therefore, the gene symbol 'prv' is proposed for PRSV-W resistance in PI 244017, PI 244019, and PI 485583 in watermelon. The USDA germplasm collection of 1613 introduction accessions, as well as 41 watermelon cultivars, was screened for resistance to the Florida strain of Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV-FL). The experiment was a randomized complete block with four replications. A retest study was conducted after the germplasm screening to verify the reaction of the most resistant and susceptible accessions. The PI accessions with the highest resistance to ZYMV were PI 595203, PI 537277, PI 560016, PI 386016, PI 386019, PI 485580, PI 494529, and PI 595200. PI 595203 was the most resistant accession based on both the germplasm screening and the retest study. PI accessions with the highest resistance to ZYMV-FL that also had resistance to other watermelon viruses PRSV-W and WMV (Watermelon mosaic virus, formerly Watermelon mosaic virus-2) were PI 595203, PI 386015, PI 386016, PI 386024, PI 386025, PI 386026, PI 244018, PI 244019, PI 485583, and PI 494528, PI 494529.},

abstract = {Watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. {\&} Nakai] is a major cucurbit crop that accounted for 7.5 {\%} of the world area devoted to vegetable production in 2003. Potyviruses are a major limiting factor in commercial watermelon production worldwide. The major viruses affecting watermelon are Papaya ringspot viruswatermelon strain (PRSV-W), Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV), and Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV). Sources of resistance to PRSV-W have been reported. These were PI (plant introduction) accessions from South Africa (PI 244017, PI 244018, PI 244019), from Zimbabwe (PI 482342, PI 482318, PI 482379), from Botswana (PI 485583), and from Nigeria (PI 595203). A single recessive gene controls resistance to PRSV-W, with the gene symbol prv. Resistance to WMV is a quantitative trait in watermelon, with approximately 3 major loci involved. PI 595203 is resistant to ZYMV, and is also moderately resistant to WMV. The USDA germplasm collection of 1613 PI accessions was screened for resistance to the Florida strain of Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV-FL). A high level of resistance to ZYMV-FL was found in several accessions: PI 386019, PI 490377, PI 596662, PI 485580, PI 560016, PI 494528, PI 386016, PI 482276, and PI 595201. The study also confirmed the resistance of PI 595203, PI 386025, PI 386026, and PI 494528 that was reported previously. Resistance of PI 595203 was confirmed to the three potyviruses PRSV-W, WMV, and ZYMV, so it will be useful in the development of multiple-virus resistant cultivars. Inheritance of resistance to Zucchini yellow mosaic virus-China strain (ZYMV-CH) and ZYMV-FL in PI 595203 was reported to be controlled by a single recessive gene. Further research is needed to determine whether resistance genes for ZYMV-FL in PI 482261 and in PI 595203 are allelic.},

Four families of six progenies (P r , P s , F 1 , F 2 , BC 1 P r , and BC 1 P s) were developed from four crosses of resistant PI accessions by susceptible cultivars. Each family was tested in 2002 and 2003 in North Carolina under field and greenhouse conditions for resistance to GSB. Artificial inoculation was used to induce uniform and strong epidemics. The effect of the Mendelian gene for resistance, db, was tested. Partial failure of the data to fit the single-gene inheritance suggested that resistance to GSB of PI 482283 and PI 526233 may be under the control of a more complex genetic system.},

The grafting technique is an alternative for reducing losses from these pathogens, making watermelon crops possible in areas where soil-borne diseases are a limiting factor. Two experiments were established for two years in "Almeria- type" plastic greenhouses in Almeria, Spain, to evaluate the influence of four rootstocks on cv. Reina de Corazones triploid watermelon yield and quality. These experiments did not use pollinating varieties. Ovary development was achieved with N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N-phenylurea (CPPU) plant growth regulator at a concentration of 200 mg.L-1. Experiments were conducted under plastic greenhouses in the spring of 2003 and 2004. RS-841 and Shintoza (both Cucurbita maxima x Cucurbita moschata) were the rootstocks with the highest percentage of plants affected by nematode, Meloidogyne incognita. Reina de Corazones obtained its highest yield when grafted on PI-296341-FR Citrullus lanatus var citroides, with very low levels of parasitic nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita). None of these rootstocks significativelly affected the quantity of total soluble solids, presenting values above 11.17Â° Brix.},

Three tomato rootstocks; 'TX301', 'Multifort', and 'Aloha', were tested in addition to the nongrafted scion, 'Florida-47'. Two muskmelon rootstocks; Cucumis metuliferus and 'Tetsukabuto' (Cucurbita maxima Ã— Cucurbita moschata) were evaluated with the nongrafted scion 'Athena'. Two watermelon rootstocks included 'Emphasis', a lagenaria-type, and an interspecific squash hybrid 'StrongTosa', which were grafted to the scion 'TriX Palomar' and planted only in the second year. Microplots were infested with M. incognita eggs in September each year. Tomatoes were planted in September followed by melons in March. In both years of the study, M. incognita juveniles (J2) in soil were similar among all tomato rootstocks, but numbers in roots were higher in the nongrafted Florida 47 than in all grafted rootstocks. In muskmelon only C. metuliferus rootstock reduced galling in nematode infested soil. Tetsukabuto did not reduce numbers of M. incognita J2 in either soil or roots either year. There were no differences in nematode numbers, galling, or plant growth parameters among the watermelon rootstocks tested. The use of resistant rootstocks has great potential for improving nematode control in the absence of soil fumigants.},

However, vegetables are highly sensitive to climatic vagaries and sudden irregularities in weather factors at any phase of crop growth can affect the normal growth, flowering, fruit development and subsequently the yield. Grafting in vegetable has emerged as a promising surgical alternative over relatively slow conventional breeding methods aimed at increasing tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. It provides an opportunity to transfer some genetic variations of specific traits of rootstocks to influence the phenotype of scion. Thus, genetic potential of various rootstocks in vegetable crops has proven to be a better alternative to chemical sterilants against many soil-borne diseases. The higher physiological activities like antioxidant content, lipoxygenase activity, osmotic adjustment, membrane selectivity, development of adventitious root and aerenchymatous tissue in plants grafted onto potential rootstocks provide broad insight into stress response mechanisms and thus, grafting is proposed to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change on productivity and quality of vegetables crops.},

@article{Kyriacou2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Kyriacou, Rouphael, Colla, Zrenner and Schwarz. Grafting has become an imperative for intensive vegetable production since chlorofluorocarbon-based soil fumigants were banned from use on grounds of environmental protection. Compelled by this development, research into rootstock-scion interaction has broadened the potential applications of grafting in the vegetable industry beyond aspects of soil phytopathology. Grafting has been increasingly tapped for cultivation under adverse environs posing abiotic and biotic stresses to vegetable crops, thus enabling expansion of commercial production onto otherwise underexploited land. Vigorous rootstocks have been employed not only in the open field but also under protected cultivation where increase in productivity improves distribution of infrastructural and energy costs. Applications of grafting have expanded mainly in two families: the Cucurbitaceae and the Solanaceae, both of which comprise major vegetable crops. As the main drives behind the expansion of vegetable grafting have been the resistance to soilborne pathogens, tolerance to abiotic stresses and increase in yields, rootstock selection and breeding have accordingly conformed to the prevailing demand for improving productivity, arguably at the expense of fruit quality. It is, however, compelling to assess the qualitative implications of this growing agronomic practice for human nutrition. Problems of impaired vegetable fruit quality have not infrequently been associated with the practice of grafting. Accordingly, the aim of the current review is to reassess how the practice of grafting and the prevalence of particular types of commercial rootstocks influence vegetable fruit quality and, partly, storability. Physical, sensorial and bioactive aspects of quality are examined with respect to grafting for watermelon, melon, cucumber, tomato, eggplant, and pepper. The physiological mechanisms at play which mediate rootstock effects on scion performance are discussed in interpreting the implications of grafting for the configuration of vegetable fruit physicochemical quality and nutritive value.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. BACKGROUND: The configuration of watermelon fruit quality was analysed in a multi-factorial approach accounting for the effects of grafting, harvest maturity and postharvest storage. Diploid, seeded, hybrid cv. Pegasus, cultivated as scion on interspecific hybrid squash rootstock TZ148 and as non-grafted control, was stored at 25Â°C following sequential harvests from the onset of ripening to over-maturity. RESULTS: Delayed rootstock-mediated climax in pulp lycopene and chroma was observed, while both were heightened by postharvest storage when harvest preceded full maturity. Pulp firmness was increased by 46.5{\%} on TZ148, while postharvest decrease in firmness was non-significant. Non-grafted fruits attained their peak in pulp carbohydrate content earlier during ripening. Monosaccharide content declined and sucrose content increased both preharvest and postharvest; overall sugar content declined by 4.3{\%} during storage. Pulp acidity decreased steadily with ripening but was moderately increased by grafting. Citrulline content increased by 12.5{\%} on TZ148; moreover, it climaxed with ripening and declined with storage only in grafted fruit. CONCLUSION: Grafting enhances pulp texture and bioactive composition. Potential suppression of sugar content as a result of grafting is minimized at full commercial maturity. Brief postharvest ambient storage enhances pulp lycopene and chroma, especially in early-picked fruit, notwithstanding the depletion of monosaccharides and citrulline and a limited deterioration of texture.},

abstract = {Vegetable production with grafted seedlings was originated in Japan and Korea to avoid the serious crop loss caused by infection of soil-borne diseases aggravated by successive cropping. This practice is now rapidly spreading and expanding over the world. Vegetable grafting has been safely adapted for the production of organic as well as environmentally friendly produce and minimizes uptake of undesirable agrochemical residues. The number and size of commercial vegetable seedling producers has increased markedly reflecting the increase in farmers' preferences for grafted seedlings of high-quality and better performance. In addition to the widely recognized advantages of disease tolerance and high crop yields, grafting technology is also highly effective in ameliorating crop losses caused by adverse environmental conditions such as low soil temperature and high soil salts, especially under protected cultivations where successive cropping or continuous farming is routinely practiced. Grafted seedlings are much favored in hydroponics farming systems where the chances of rapid spread of noxious diseases, once infected, is high. Active research has been focused to develop efficient rootstocks and handy grafting tools. In addition, researchers are eager to develop grafting machines or robots to reduce the higher price of grafted seedlings. The quality of grafted transplants is extremely important to maximize high-quality crop yield. Use of grafted vegetables has increased with the increased use of improved soil mix or substrate, farmer's preferences for better seedlings, efficient management of nursery systems, lower prices of grafted seedlings, and efficient nationwide delivery and/or transportation system. Improved grafting methods to cut down the labor cost for grafting and subsequent handling of plug-grown grafted transplants will contribute further to the increased use of grafted vegetables worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This book provides comprehensive, current scientific and applied practical knowledge on vegetable grafting, a method gaining considerable interest that is used to protect crops from soil-borne diseases, abiotic stress and to enhance growth/yield. Though the benefits of using grafted transplants are now fully recognized worldwide, understanding the rootstock-scion interactions under variable environmental pressures remains vital for grafting-mediated crop improvement. In this book the authors attend to this need and explain the reasons for, and methods and applications of, grafting. Vegetable Grafting: Principles and Practices covers: â€¢ rootstock breeding, signalling, and physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in grafting; â€¢ beneficial effects of grafting including reducing disease damage and abiotic stress; â€¢ side effects relating to the impact of grafting on fruit quality; and â€¢ practical applications and speciality crops. Including high-quality colour images and written by an international team of expert authors, this book provides up-to-date scientific data and is also concerned with translating science to the field. It is an essential resource for researchers, advanced technicians, practitioners and extension workers. {\textcopyright} 2017 by CAB International.},

abstract = {As a result of many years of domestication and selection for desirable fruit quality, most of the modern dessert watermelon cultivars share a narrow genetic base. Africa is the center of origin and diversity of the genus Citrullus and is thus the focus of efforts to collect and conserve germplasm for enhancing dessert watermelons with resistance to diseases and pests. In addition to C. lanatus, accessions of several other species of Citrullus have been used as sources of disease and pest resistance. These are C. amarus (citron watermelon), which is native to southern Africa, C. mucosospermus (egusi watermelon) of sub-Saharan/western Africa origin, and C. colocynthis (colocynth) native to the deserts of northern Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Citrullus amarus, C. lanatus, and C. mucosospermus are readily intercrossed with one another and thus C. amarus and C. mucosospermus have at times been classified as subspecies or botanical varieties within C. lanatus. Genetic resources within Citrullus contain genes conferring resistance to a broad range of fungal diseases such as Fusarium wilt, anthracnose, gummy stem blight; oomycete diseases including Phytophthora capsici, powdery mildew, downy mildew; viruses such as the watermelon strain of Papaya ringspot virus, Zucchini yellow mosaic virus, and Squash vein yellowing virus (SqVYV); and insect pests such as root-knot nematodes, whiteflies, and mites. Watermelon germplasm collections are maintained in China, South Africa and Zimbabwe. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS), maintains a large collection of watermelon and related Citrullus spp. germplasm. The USDA/ARS/NPGS, Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs contains general information on accessions held within the USDA/NPGS collection.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 British Society for Plant Pathology. The suitability of watermelon cultivars and cucurbit rootstocks as hosts to Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica was determined in pot and field experiments. Meloidogyne incognita showed higher reproduction than did M. javanica on watermelon and cucurbit rootstocks. The watermelon cultivars did not differ in host status when challenged with these two species and supported lower nematode reproduction than the cucurbit rootstocks. Rootstocks Lagenaria siceraria cv. Pelops and Cucurbita pepo AK15 supported lower reproduction than did the squash hybrid rootstocks (C. maxima Ã— C. moschata). Egg production increased (P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}05) with a rising initial inoculum level (Pi) in the non-grafted Sugar Baby but the reproduction factor Rf (eggs per plant/Pi) was similar at two Pi levels. The total egg production in the plants grafted onto squash hybrids RS841 and Titan was greater (P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}05) at the higher Pi, but the Rf values were lower. The development of field-grown non-grafted watermelon plants was significantly stunted in plots where nematodes were detected at planting. However, no differences were observed in plots with grafted plants. In plots with nematodes, non-grafted and Titan-grafted plants had similar yields that were higher than that of RS841-grafted plants. In the commercial plastic houses with grafted watermelon, the average Rf value was 42-fold, confirming the high susceptibility of squash hybrids as rootstocks for grafted watermelon. The Titan-Sugar Baby combination was tolerant to M. javanica.},

abstract = {Yield and fruit characteristics of grafted plants of the 'Reina de Corazones' watermelon cultivar (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum and Nakai), grown in Fusarium-infestated soils, were determined in a series of experiments performed in the 8-year period 1993-2000. The experiments were performed in the coastal area south Valencia, Spain, in soils with a clay content ranging from 16 to 38{\%}. Plant survival and yield were the highest in plants grafted onto several Cucurbita maxima Ã— Cucurbita moschata hybrids and onto 'Jover' and 'Bodi 1' C. moschata cultivars. The survival ratio of the plants grafted onto 'Shintoza' rootstock (C. maxima Ã— C. moschata) was 93{\%}, while the mean yield in an early production cycle with harvests extending from the end of June to mid-August was 89,000 kg ha-1. The 'Shintoza' rootstock increased fruit size compared to the non-grafted plants, and improved yield stability by decreasing the coefficient of variation to 20{\%}. The use of 'Shintoza' rootstock had no effect on the soluble solids concentration of the central endocarp, and did not increase the development of yellowish bands in the flesh or the internal breakdown of the endocarp. The use of this rootstock is an advantageous alternative to soil fumigation by methyl bromide for the control of Fusarium wilt in watermelon production, as it is cheaper and safer, and the yields are higher and more reliable. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â‰¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A study of life-history traits was made to determine factors associated with the fitness of Meloidogyne incognita isolates virulent to resistance gene Rk in cowpea. Egg hatch, root penetration, egg mass production, and fecundity (eggs per egg mass) of avirulent and virulent phenotypes were compared among M. incognita isolates, isofemale lines, and single descent lines over multiple generations on resistant and susceptible cowpea. Variation (P {\textless}/= 0.05) in both hatch and root penetration rates was found among isolates at a given generation. However, this variation was not consistent within nematode lines among generations, and there was no correlation with level of virulence, except for penetration and virulence on resistant cowpea at generation 20. Resistant and susceptible cowpea roots were penetrated at similar levels. Differences in reproductive factors on resistant plants were correlated with levels of virulence expression. In some isofemale lines, single descent lines, and isolates, lower (P {\textless}/= 0.05) rates of egg mass production and fecundity on susceptible cowpea were associated with virulence to Rk, indicating a trade-off between reproductive fitness and virulence. Other virulent nematode lines from the same isolates did not have reduced reproductive ability on susceptible cowpea over 27 generations. Thus, virulent lineages varied in reproductive ability on susceptible cowpea, contributing to adaptation and maintenance of virulence within M. incognita populations under stabilizing selection.},

abstract = {Solanum torvum is a highly vigorous relative of eggplant that is resistant to a number of harmful soil-borne diseases and is compatible for grafting with eggplant. Being a potential rootstock, this plant frequently presents poor and erratic germination, which makes its practical use difficult. We used an L8 (27) orthogonal array design to evaluate the primary effects of seven factors (soaking of seeds, scarification with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), application of gibberellic acid (GA3), use of potassium mitrate (KNO3) as a moistening agent, cold stratification, application of a heat shock, and light irradiation during germination) at two levels (L0 and L1) using four germination parameters (early and final germination, germination rate and vigour index) in fresh S. torvum seeds. S. torvum seeds had a strong dormancy with no germination in the untreated seeds and high early and final germination (approximately 100{\%}) in certain treatments. An evaluation of the main effects revealed highly positive effects on germination from seed soaking, and the use of GA3, KNO3, and light irradiation, whereas NaClO scarification had a negative effect. The application of cold stratification and heat shock treatments also had a positive effect on seed germination but to a lesser extent than the other treatments. An improved proposed protocol that consisted of subjecting seeds to soaking, the application of GA3 and KNO3, cold stratification, heat shock, and light irradiation was validated and demonstrated to be highly effective, with seed germination success greater than 60{\%} being observed at 3 days and final germination reaching a plateau at 6 days. A second validation experiment using a commercial growing substrate also showed a high emergence (approximately 50{\%}) at 7 days and a final germination of approximately 80{\%} was recorded with application of the improved protocol. The seed germination protocol that we have developed will facilitate the use of S. torvum as a rootstock for eggplant and its use in breeding programmes. Our results also reveal that orthogonal array designs are a powerful tool for establishing improved protocols for seed germination.},

None of the of M. arenaria race 2 or M. javanica populations parasitized any of the resistant pepper cultivars used, but all of the M. hapla populations reproduced on resistant peppers. Forty-three populations were found to parasitize both susceptible and resistant pepper cultivars, of those, 37 populations belonged to M. incognita (all races), one to M. arenaria (new race 3), and five to M. hapla races A and B. Seventeen of the M. incognita populations that were virulent on resistant pepper did not parasitize the resistant tomato cv. Nikita containing the Mi gene.

abstract = {The root-knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne incognita is a major soil parasite of pepper crops in greenhouses in Southeast Spain. Due to the limitations of the use of soil fumigants, grafting plants on resistant rootstocks (R-rootstocks) has become an important alternative to chemical nematicides. The repeated use of R-rootstocks can bring about the selection of virulent populations capable of overcoming resistance. We carried out a six-year investigation on resistant rootstocks in a naturally M. incognita infested greenhouse, and found that two successive years of growing plants grafted on R-rootstocks Atlante (ATL) were sufficient to overcome resistance (galling index 1.5 and 5.6 in the first and second years respectively). A large variability was observed between several R-rootstocks. Two R-rootstocks (C19 and Snooker) behaved like ATL while two others (Terrano and DRO 8801) were not infected by RKN. Laboratory studies with the same R-rootstocks, inoculated with two nematode isolates (avirulent and virulent against ATL) confirmed the greenhouse results, indicating that some rootstocks may be infested by virulent populations and others may not. It suggests that different R-genes, which are differentially overcome by RKN, have been introgressed into the rootstocks. This may have consequences for the management of resistant rootstocks in the field.},

abstract = {The eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) is one of the most widely cultivated crops in tropical and temperate regions around the world and is suitable for propagation through grafting. In many parts of the world, grafting is a routine technique used in continuous cropping systems, because in the horticulture field is a sustainable technique that allows cultivators to overcome abiotic or biotic stress. The objective of this research was to evaluate the suitability at the grafting of four Sicilian eggplant ecotypes grown in open field in Sicily, Italy. Vegetables in general are a great source of minerals in the human diet and the eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) provides significant quantities of various minerals, among which are P, K, Ca and Mg. The study demonstrated that grafting increased marketable yield. Furthermore, grafting has increased the amount of Ca, Fe, Zn and Cu in the fruit, while reducing the amount of Na, Mg and Mn. This variation is of significant interest, as lower levels of Na and Mn favour a reduction in hypertension and help keep blood pressure under control. Grafted plant height after 35 days is positively correlated with the average number of marketable fruits per plant (r = 0.607) and percentage of discard production (r = 0.583). Furthermore, after 35 days, the non-grafted plant's height was also negatively correlated with the total average production (r = -0.528), the average marketable production (r = -0.558), and the average weight of marketable fruits (r = -0.815). This research confirmed that Solanum torvum selection Australys rootstock gave Sicilian eggplant ecotypes increased vigor in the initial 35 days from planting, increased yields while increasing the number of marketable fruit, and creating fruit with more healthful qualities.},

abstract = {Grafting is generally considered effective in ameliorating vegetable crop tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. The use of interspecific hybrid as rootstock for eggplant may represent a valid alternative approach to enhance eggplant performance. However, studies on the effects of different rootstocks on eggplant plant vigor, yield, and fruit quality traits often show conflicting results. Thus, an experiment was performed in two springâ€“summer growing seasons (2014 and 2015) by grafting eggplant 'Scarlatti' F1 hybrid on two accessions of S. aethiopicum gr. gilo and on the interspecific hybrid S. melongena Ã— S. aehtiopicumgr. gilo in comparison to the most common eggplant rootstock S. torvum. Results indicate that S. melongena Ã— S. aethiopicum gr. gilo interspecific hybrid and S. torvum improved grafting success, plant vigor, early flowering and yield in 'Scarlatti' F1 scion. All rootstocks tested did not negatively influence fruit apparent quality traits and fruit quality composition. Moreover, fruit glycoalkaloids content remained below the recommended threshold value. These findings suggest that the use of S. melongena Ã— S. aethiopicum gr. gilo interspecific hybrid as rootstock may be a good alternative to the most commonly used S. torvum.},

Nematode densities were determined at the beginning and end of each crop. Yield was assessed in eight plants per plot weekly for 6 weeks. The P-f/ Pi values were 0.28 and 21.6 after three crops of resistant or susceptible cultivars, respectively. Growth of resistant as opposed to susceptible tomato cultivars in non-fumigated soil increased profits by 30,000 euros ha(-1). The resistant Monika in non- fumigated soil yielded similarly ( P {\textgreater} 0.05) to the susceptible Durinta in methyl bromide fumigated soil but the resistant tomato provided a benefit of 8800 euros ha(-1) over the susceptible one because of the cost of fumigation. Selection for virulence did not occur, although the nematode population subjected to the resistant cultivar for three consecutive seasons produced four times more eggs than the population on the susceptible one. Such a difference was also shown when the resistant cultivar was subjected to high continuous inoculum pressure for 14 weeks. The Mi-resistance gene can be an effective and economic alternative to methyl bromide in plastic-houses infested with root-knot nematodes, but should be used in an integrated management context to preserve its durability and prevent the selection of virulent populations due to variability in isolate reproduction and environmental conditions.},

Nematode population densities in soil and roots, reproduction indices, and tomato yield were compared for each cropping cycle and rotation. Average pre-plant nematode densities (Pi) at the beginning of the study were 247, 7, and 172 juveniles per 250 cm 3 of soil at Barcelona, Eivissa and C{\'{a}}diz, respectively. The Mi resistant tomato cv. Monika suppressed M. javanica at Barcelona and Eivissa, and M. arenaria and M. incognita at C{\'{a}}diz, and prevented nematode population increases by more than 90{\%} compared with the susceptible cv. Durinta. At Barcelona, the 3-year average tomato yield increased by 2.6 kg m -2 in the rotations including at least one resistant tomato crop, and by 6.1 kg m -2 when the resistant cultivar was cropped for two consecutive years. However, no differences in yield were found at Eivissa due to low Pi, nor at C{\'{a}}diz where the resistant cultivar was poorly adapted to the agroclimatic conditions of the area. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In both years, RKN infection was severe in â€˜Emphasis' bottle gourd, â€˜Strong Tosa' hybrid squash, and wild tinda rootstocks with galling of the root system ranging from 86{\%} to 100{\%}. In 2009, the RKVL wild watermelon rootstocks exhibited lower ( P {\textless} 0.05) percentages of root galling (range 9{\%} to 16{\%}) than non-grafted â€˜Tri-X 313' (41{\%}), â€˜Emphasis', â€˜Strong Tosa', and the wild tinda rootstocks. The grafted wild watermelon rootstock RKVL 318 produced more ( P â‰¤ 0.05) fruit (12 per plot) than all other entries (mean = five per plot), and it produced a heavier ( P â‰¤ 0.05) fruit yield (29.5 kg per plot) than all entries except self-grafted â€˜Tri-X 313' (21.5 kg per plot). In 2010, soil in half of the plots was treated with methyl bromide (50{\%}):chloropicrin (50{\%}) (392 kg{\textperiodcentered}ha â€“1 ) before planting. The RKVL wild watermelon rootstocks exhibited resistance to RKN with percentages of root system galled ranging from 11{\%} for RKVL 316 to 56{\%} for RKVL 301 in the untreated control plots. Fruit yields in the untreated plots were 21.9, 25.6, and 19.9 kg/plot for RKVL 301, RKVL 316, and RKVL 318, respectively. Yields were greater ( P â‰¤ 0.05) for the three RKVL rootstocks than for â€˜Strong Tosa' (3.0 kg) and â€˜Ojakkyo' wild watermelon rootstock (2.8 kg) in the untreated plots. Yields of watermelon grafted on â€˜Strong Tosa' were nearly seven times greater ( P â‰¤ 0.05) in the methyl bromide-treated plots than in the untreated plots. In contrast, yields of RKVL 316 and RKVL 318 were similar in both treatments and the yield of RKVL 301 was less ( P â‰¤ 0.05) in the methyl bromide-treated plots than in the untreated plots. The three RKVL wild watermelon rootstock lines exhibited resistance to RKN. RKVL 316 had low root galling and produced the heaviest fruit yield and greatest numbers of fruit of any rootstock evaluated in 2010. The RKVL lines should be useful sources of RKN resistance for rootstocks for grafted watermelon.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Society of Nematologists. Southern root-knot nematode (RKN, Meloidogyne incognita) is a serious pest of cultivated watermelon (Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus) in southern regions of the United States and no resistance is known to exist in commercial watermelon cultivars. Wild watermelon relatives (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides) have been shown in greenhouse studies to possess varying degrees of resistance to RKN species. Experiments were conducted over 2 yr to assess resistance of southern RKN in C. lanatus var. citroides accessions from the U.S. Watermelon Plant Introduction Collection in an artificially infested field site at the U.S. Vegetable Laboratory in Charleston, SC. In the first study (2006), 19 accessions of C. lanatus var. citroides were compared with reference entries of Citrullus colocynthis and C. lanatus var. lanatus. Of the wild watermelon accessions, two entries exhibited significantly less galling than all other entries. Five of the best performing C. lanatus var. citroides accessions were evaluated with and without nematicide at the same field site in 2007. Citrullus lanatus var. citroides accessions performed better than C. lanatus var. lanatus and C. colocynthis. Overall, most entries of C. lanatus var. citroides performed similarly with and without nematicide treatment in regard to root galling, visible egg masses, vine vigor, and root mass. In both years of field evaluations, most C. lanatus var. citroides accessions showed lesser degrees of nematode reproduction and higher vigor and root mass than C. colocynthis and C. lanatus var. lanatus. The results of these two field evaluations suggest that wild watermelon populations may be useful sources of resistance to southern RKN.},

abstract = {Southern root-knot nematodes ( Meloidogyne incognita ) are an important re-emerging pest of watermelon in the United States and worldwide. The re-emergence of root-knot nematodes (RKNs) in watermelon and other cucurbits is largely the result of the intensive cultivation of vegetable crops on limited agricultural lands coupled with the loss of methyl bromide for pre-plant soil fumigation, which has been the primary method for control of RKNs and many soilborne diseases of cucurbits and other vegetable crops for several decades. One alternative for managing RKN in watermelon is the use of resistant rootstocks for grafted watermelon. We have developed several RKN-resistant Citrullus lanatus var. citroides lines (designated RKVL for Root-Knot Vegetable Laboratory), which have shown promise as rootstocks for grafted watermelon. In 2011 and 2012, we demonstrated that F1 hybrids derived from our selected RKVL lines exhibited resistance to RKN that was equal to or greater than that of the parental RKVL lines when grown in fields highly infested with M. incognita . In 2011, although significant differences were not observed among rootstocks, the F1 hybrids produced slightly higher yields compared with the selected parental lines. Among the selected parental lines, RKVL 318 produced high yields in both years.

'Charleston Belle' exhibited minimal root galling and nematode reproduction, and 'Keystone Resistant Giant' exhibited severe root galling and high nematode reproduction. Cucumber grown in plots following 'Charleston Belle' had lower (P less than or equal to 0.001) root gall severity indices than following 'Keystone Resistant Giant' (4.2 versus 4.9, respectively). Cucumber yields were 87{\%} heavier (P less than or equal to 0.0001) and numbers of fruit were 85{\%} higher (P less than or equal to 0.0001) in plots previously planted to 'Charleston Belle' than to 'Keystone Resistant Giant'. Squash grown in plots following 'Charleston Belle' had lower (P less than or equal to 0.001) root gall severity indices than following 'Keystone Resistant Giant' (4.0 versus 4.8, respectively). Squash yields were 55{\%} heavier (P less than or equal to 0.01) and numbers of fruit were 50{\%} higher (P less than or equal to 0.001) in plots previously planted to 'Charleston Belle' than to 'Keystone Resistant Giant'. These results demonstrate that root-knot nematode-resistant bell pepper cultivars such as 'Charleston Belle' are useful tools for managing M. incognita in double-cropping systems with cucurbit crops.},

All C . colocynthis accessions were highly susceptible (GI range = 8.5 to 9.0). However, 20 of 88 C. lanatus var. citroides accessions were moderately resistant with a GI range of 3.1 to 4.0; overall GI range for the C. lanatus var. citroides accessions was 3.1 to 9.0. Resistance to M. arenaria race 1 identified in the C. lanatus var. citroides accessions was confirmed on a subset of accessions in a replicated greenhouse test. The results of our evaluations demonstrated that there is significant genetic variability within the U.S. PI Citrullus germplasm collection for resistance to M. arenaria race 1 and also identified C. lanatus var. citroides accessions as potential sources of resistance.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH Two genotypes of root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne arenaria (A2-O and A2-J), are found in Japan. They were distinguished from each other based on mitochondrial DNA sequences. The primer set (C2F3/1108) amplified a 1.7-kb fragment from A2-J, whereas a 1.1-kb fragment was amplified from A2-O. M. arenaria (A2-O) was detected in local regions of southern Japan, whereas M. arenaria (A2-J) was widespread from the Kyushu region to the Tohoku region. The distribution of M. arenaria (A2-J) overlaps with the cultivation area of eggplant. Solanum torvum is used worldwide as a rootstock for eggplant cultivation, and it is resistant to Meloidogyne spp. In particular, it is reported that S. torvum is resistant to M. arenaria outside Japan. In this study, we inoculated S. torvum rootstock cultivars with M. arenaria (A2-J), M. arenaria (A2-O) and Meloidogyne incognita populations. Although M. incognita and M. arenaria (A2-O) produced only a few egg masses on S. torvum, thereby confirming its resistance, the four geographical populations of M. arenaria (A2-J) produced large numbers of egg masses on S. torvum. This study confirmed that S. torvum is resistant to M. incognita and M. arenaria (A2-O) populations, but susceptible to populations of M. arenaria (A2-J) in the eggplant production area of Japan.},

Thermal requirements for M. incognita and M. javanica were determined by cultivating zucchini plants in pots inoculated with 200 second stage juveniles (J2) of each Meloidogyne species at constant temperatures of 17, 21, 25, and 28 Â°C. Number of days from nematode inoculation until appearance of egg laying females and until egg hatching were separately recorded. For life cycle completion, base temperatures (Tb) of 12 oC and 10.8 oC and accumulated degree-days above Tb (S) of 456 and 526, were estimated for M. incognita and M. javanica, respectively. The relationship between fruit weight and M. incognita Pi fits the Seinhorst damage function, but differed accordingly to the cropping season, spring or autumn. Tolerance limits for M. incognita on zucchini were 8.1 J2 per 250 cm3 of soil in spring and 1.5 in autumn cropping cycles, and the minimum relative yields were 0.61 in spring and 0.69 in autumn. Zucchini-squash was a poorer host for M. incognita in spring than in autumn, since maximum multiplication rates (a) and equilibrium densities (E) were lower in spring (a = 16-96; E = 274-484) than in autumn (a = 270-2307; E = 787-1227). {\textcopyright} 2014 Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.},

Treatment included an experimental rootstock cv. PG76 (Solanum lycopersicum x Solanum sp.), a commercial rootstock cv. Brigeor (S. lycopersicum x S. habrochaites), a resistant tomato cv. Monika (S. lycopersicum), and a Susceptible cv. Durinta (S. lycopersicum). Based on the reproduction index (RI: number of eggs per g root on the resistant cultivar divided by number of eggs per g root oil the Susceptible cultivar x 100), rootstock cv. PG76 responded as highly resistant (RI = 70{\%}) after the first cropping cycle (3.4 nematode generations), showed intermediated resistance (RI = 33{\%}) after the second cropping cycle (3.3 generations), and was fully susceptible (RI = 94{\%}) after the third cycle (3-3 generations). In contrast, rootstock cv. Brigeor and resistant cv. Monika retained intermediate resistance levels (RI = 41 and 25{\%}, respectively) after the third cropping cycle. Virulent nematode populations were rapidly selected from an avirulent one after repeated cultivation of resistant tomatoes under field conditions. Bioassays conducted under controlled conditions confirmed that selection for virulence occurred more rapidly in plots with cv. PG76 followed by Brigeor and Monika. The nematode population in the field not exposed to Mi resistance remained avirulent to Mi genotypes. The genetic background of the resistant rootstocks and the frequency of cropping were critical factors for the appearance of virulent nematode Populations. Irrespective of nematode infection, all resistant tomatoes yielded more than the Susceptible cultivar.},

Virulent populations produced more (P{\textless} 0.05) egg masses/plant, eggs/plant, eggs/g root, and showed higher infection frequencies and multiplication rates than the avirulent populations. The fecundity of females did not differ between the resistant and susceptible genotype, and did not change with the virulence status of the populations. On the resistant genotype, the populations collected from the susceptible tomato showed lower (P{\textless} 0.05) reproductive traits than those collected from rootstocks followed by those from resistant tomato. Meloidogyne javanica produced more (P{\textless} 0.05) egg masses/plant and eggs/g root than Meloidogyne incognita on the resistant genotype. A time course experiment was conducted to determine if root penetration by M. javanica populations with different Mi.1 virulence status is conditioned by the expression of resistance on tomato. Significant differences between populations were observed as early as of 2 days post-inoculation on the susceptible genotype. On the resistant genotype, low juvenile numbers from populations with acquired virulence penetrated the roots up to 4 dpi, but their numbers significantly increased 7 dpi. Juveniles of the natural virulent population followed similar penetration pattern on the resistant and susceptible genotypes. Peroxidases are involved in the oxidative burst typically associated with the hypersensitive response in incompatible host-pathogen interactions. Isoelectrofocusing isozyme analysis revealed an increase in the peroxidase activity on the resistant genotype after inoculation with the avirulent population and to a lesser degree with the populations with acquired virulence in comparison with the natural virulent population. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Physical, chemical, and biological factors of soil may reduce damage caused by plant-parasitic nematodes. Suppression of plant-parasitic nematodes is particularly challenging in soils in which there are short crop sequences, sequential susceptible host crops, or infestations of multiple nematode species. In southern Indiana, a watermelon production system involving rotations with soybean and corn does not suppress Meloidogyne incognita, but several aspects of such systems can be modified to reduce nematode damage in an integrated management approach. Cash crops with resistance to M. incognita can be used to reduce population densities of M. incognita. Small grains as cover crops can be replaced by cover crops with resistance to M. incognita or by crops with biofumigation potential. Mycorrhizal fungal inoculations of potting mixes during transplanting production of watermelon seedlings may improve early crop establishment. Other approaches to nematode management utilize soil suppressiveness. One-year rotations of soybean with corn neither reduced the soil-bome complex of sudden death syndrome (SDS) nor improved soybean root health over that in soybean monoculture. Reduced tillage combined with crop rotation may reduce the activity of soil-borne pathogens in some soils. For example in a long-term trial, numbers of Heterodera glycines and severity of foliar SDS symptoms were reduced under minimum tillage. Thus, sustainable management strategies require holistic approaches that consider entire production systems rather than focus on a single crop in its year of production. {\textcopyright} The Society of Nematologists 2011.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) and turkey berry (S. torvum Sw.), a wild ally of eggplant with promising multi-disease resistance traits, are of great economic, medicinal and genetic importance, but genomic resources for these species are lacking. In the present study, we sequenced the transcriptomes of eggplant and turkey berry to accelerate research on these two non-model species.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We built comprehensive, high-quality de novo transcriptome assemblies of the two Leptostemonum clade Solanum species from short-read RNA-Sequencing data. We obtained 34,174 unigenes for eggplant and 38,185 unigenes for turkey berry. Functional annotations based on sequence similarity to known plant datasets revealed a distribution of functional categories for both species very similar to that of tomato. Comparison of eggplant, turkey berry and another 11 plant proteomes resulted in 276 high-confidence single-copy orthologous groups, reasonable phylogenetic tree inferences and reliable divergence time estimations. From these data, it appears that eggplant and its wild Leptostemonum clade relative turkey berry split from each other in the late Miocene, {\~{}}6.66 million years ago, and that Leptostemonum split from the Potatoe clade in the middle Miocene, {\~{}}15.75 million years ago. Furthermore, 621 and 815 plant resistance genes were identified in eggplant and turkey berry respectively, indicating the variation of disease resistance genes between them.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides a comprehensive transcriptome resource for two Leptostemonum clade Solanum species and insight into their evolutionary history and biological characteristics. These resources establish a foundation for further investigations of eggplant biology and for agricultural improvement of this important vegetable. More generally, we show that RNA-Seq is a fast, reliable and cost-effective method for assessing genome evolution in non-model species.},

abstract = {The rootstock potential of Turkish Lagenaria siceraria germplasm for watermelon was evaluated. Among 210 accessions, 72 genotypes were selected based on morphological characteristics. Two commercial hybrid rootstocks were also used for comparison. Crimson Tide watermelon cultivar was used as a scion. Emergence rate, hypocotyl morphology, survival rate, and resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON) were investigated. Grafted plants were grown for 3 weeks in order to investigate the effect of rootstocks on plant growth. Leaf number, shoot dry weight, and root dry weight were determined. Emergence rate was ranked between 72{\%} and 100{\%} in collected genotypes. The highest graft compatibility was 99{\%} while the lowest graft compatibility was 70{\%}. All the grafted plants showed better performance than control plants regarding plant growth. All bottle gourd genotypes were tested against known 3 races of FON and all of them showed resistance against it. However, 9 genotypes showed yellowing but reisolation from those plants showed that yellowing was not due to FON. Crimson Sweet watermelon cv. susceptible to 3 races of FON was grafted onto 10 Lagenaria siceraria genotypes with the highest graft compatibility with watermelon. While all grafted plants showed resistance to FON, ungrafted Crimson Sweet watermelon cv. was found susceptible to 3 races of FON. The results showed that Turkish L. siceraria germplasm has powerful rootstock potential for watermelon against Fusarium wilt and it is a good resource for rootstock breeding programs. {\textcopyright} T{\"{U}}BITAK.},

abstract = {The potential of grafted watermelon for resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. niveum on some Curcurbitaceae, Lagenaria, Luffa, Benincasa and commercial rootstocks was evaluated. Effects of grafting on yield and quality of diseased plants were evaluated. All grafted plants and rootstocks were resistant to the three known races (0, 1, and 2) of F. oxysporum f.sp. niveum except watermelon cv. 'Crimson Tide', which was susceptible to race 2. Fruit yield was positively (21-112{\%}) affected by Lagenaria rootstocks but negatively affected (200-267{\%}) by Cucurbita rootstocks when compared with the control. While only minor differences in fruit quality were determined in control and grafted plants on Lagenaria rootstocks, the quality parameters for watermelon grafted onto Cucurbita rootstocks were lower than in the control. The reasons for low yield and quality might be due to an incompatibility between Cucurbita rootstocks and watermelon. These results showed that rootstock influence on disease resistance as well as yield and quality of scion fruit is important in determining the potential use of grafting applications in watermelon.},

After sequencing these RAPD-PCR products, longer primers of 18 to 23 nucleotides were designed to complement the terminal DNA sequences of the DNA fragments. This resulted in three pairs of species specific primers that were used to amplify the sequence characterised amplified regions (SCARs). The developed sets of SCAR primers were successfully used in straightforward, fast and reliable PCR assays to identify M. incognita, M. javanica and M. arenaria. The length variant SCAR markers can be amplified from DNA from egg masses, second stage juveniles and females. This species identification technique is therefore independent of the nematode's life cycle stage. Moreover the SCAR-PCR assay was successfully applied using DNA extracts from infested plant material. The method has potential to be optimised for routine practical diagnostic tests facilitating the control of these economically important pest organisms. {\textgreater}Identification de Meloigyne incognita, M. javanica et M. arenaria au moyen de l'amplification de r{\'{e}}gions de s{\'{e}}quences caract{\'{e}}ristiques (SCAR) par une technique PCR - Trois marqueurs d'ADN polymorphique amplifi{\'{e}}e au hasard (RAPD) OPA-12420, OPB-O61200 et OPA-OI700, respectivement sp{\'{e}}cifiques des esp{\`{e}}ces de n{\'{e}}matodes Meloidogyne arenaria, M. incognita et M. javanica, ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} identifi{\'{e}}s.

abstract = {Domestication of the watermelon ( Citrullus lanatus ) has alternatively been placed in South Africa, the Nile valley, or more recently West Africa, with the oldest archeological evidence coming from Libya and Egypt. The geographic origin and domestication of watermelons has therefore remained unclear. Using extensive nuclear and plastid genomic data from a 3,560-year-old Citrullus leaf from a mummy's sarcophagus and skimmed genomes for representatives of the seven extant species of Citrullus , we show that modern cultivars and the ancient plant uniquely share mutations in a lycopene metabolism gene (LYCB) affecting pulp color and a stop codon in a transcription factor regulating bitter cucurbitacin compounds. This implies that the plant we sequenced had red-fleshed and sweet fruits and that New Kingdom Egyptians were cultivating domesticated watermelons. The genomic data also identify extant Sudanese watermelons with white, sweet pulp as the closest relatives of domesticated watermelons. Significance statement With some 197.8 million tons in 2017, watermelon, Citrullus lanatus , is among the World's most important crops, yet its area of origin and domestication have remained unclear, with competing hypotheses favoring South Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, or the Nile valley. We generated extensive nuclear and plastid genomic data from a 3500-year-old leaf from a Pharaonic sarcophagus and performed genome skimming for representatives of all other Citrullus species to compare key genes involved in fruit bitterness and color. White-fleshed, non-bitter melons from southern Sudan are the closest relatives of domesticated watermelon, and the ancient genome shares unique alleles with a red-fleshed, non-bitter domesticated form (but no wild forms), implying that 18th Dynasty Egyptians were cultivating domesticated watermelon by 3500 years ago.},

Comparative genomics analysis provided an evolutionary scenario for the origin of the 11 watermelon chromosomes derived from a 7-chromosome paleohexaploid eudicot ancestor. Resequencing of 20 watermelon accessions representing three different C. lanatus subspecies produced numerous haplotypes and identified the extent of genetic diversity and population structure of watermelon germplasm. Genomic regions that were preferentially selected during domestication were identified. Many disease-resistance genes were also found to be lost during domestication. In addition, integrative genomic and transcriptomic analyses yielded important insights into aspects of phloem-based vascular signaling in common between watermelon and cucumber and identified genes crucial to valuable fruit-quality traits, including sugar accumulation and citrulline metabolism.},

abstract = {Genetic diversity was estimated among 42 U.S. Plant Introduction (PI) accessions of the genus Citrullus (of these, 34 PIs are reported to have disease resistance), and 5 watermelon cultivars, using 30 RAPD primers. These primers produced 662 RAPD markers that could be rated with high confidence. Based on these markers, genetic similarity coefficients were calculated and a dendrogram was constructed using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average (UPGMA). The analysis delineated three major clusters. The first cluster consisted of a group of five watermelon cultivars, a group of C. lanatus var. lanatus accessions, and a group of C. lanatus var. lanatus accessions that contained some C. lanatus var. citroides genes. The second cluster consisted of the C. lanatus var. citroides accessions, while the third cluster consisted of the C. colocynthis accessions. The two C. lanatus clusters differentiated from each other and from the C. colocynthis cluster at the level of 58.8{\%} and 38.9{\%} genetic similarity, respectively. Assessment of genetic diversity among accessions that have been reported to have disease resistance indicated that resistance to either anthracnose, downy mildew, powdery mildew, or watermelon mosaic virus is found among all major groups of Citrullus PIs. Additionally, resistance to gummy stem blight or Fusarium wilt may exist among C. lanatus var. citroides PIs. This study demonstrates that molecular markers can be useful in assessing genetic diversity, and in sorting Citrullus PIs into phylogenetic groups prior to their evaluation for disease or pest resistance.},

abstract = {Watermelon belongs to the genus Citrullus . There have been continuing interests in breeding of watermelon for economic benefits, but information on the scope and utilization of genetic variations in Citrullus is still limited. The present study was conducted in 2012â€“13, to evaluate the genetic diversity and population structure of the 1197 line watermelon collection maintained by the Beijing Vegetable Research Center (BVRC), which belongs to seven Citrullus species including Citrullus naudinianus , Citrullus colocynthis , Citrullus rehmii , Citrullus ecirrhosus , Citrullus amarus , Citrullus mucosospermus , and Cirullus lanatus subsp. vulgaris . Twenty-three highly informative microsatellite markers evenly distributed in the watermelon genome were used to assess genetic diversity in this collection. The markers detected on an average of 6.05 alleles per locus with the average value of polymorphism information content (PIC) at 0.49. A high level of gene diversity [Nei's gene diversity index (Nei) = 0.56] and a low observed heterozygosity ( H o = 0.10) were revealed within the collection. Structure analysis grouped the 1197 accessions into two main populations (Pop I and Pop II) and an admixture group. Pop I contained 450 accessions from C. lanatus subsp. vulgaris (446) and C. mucosospermus (4). Pop II comprised 465 accessions, 379 of which belonged to C. lanatus subsp. vulgaris and 86 to C. naudinianus (3), C. ecirrhosus (2), C. rehmii (2), C. colocynthis (11), C. amarus (58), and C. mucosospermus (10). The remaining 282 accessions were classified as an admixture group. The two main populations were further subdivided into four subgroups. The groupings were consistent with the estimation of F statistics ( F st ) and Nei's genetic distances in collections. We confirmed the distinct genetic backgrounds between American and East Asian ecotypes. Subsequently, we defined a core set consisting of 130 accessions including 47 from Pop I, 68 from Pop II, and 15 from the Admixture group. This core set was able to capture all 133 alleles detected by 23 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in 1197 accessions. These results will facilitate efficient use of genetic variations in Citrullus in watermelon breeding and help optimization of accessions in genomewide association studies.},

	abstract = {Among plant-parasitic nematodes, the root-knot nematodes (RKNs) of the Meloidogyne spp. are the most economically important genus. RKN are root parasitic worms able to infect nearly all crop species and have a wide geographic distribution. During infection, RKNs establish and maintain an intimate relationship with the host plant. This includes the creation of a specialized nutritional structure composed of multinucleate and hypertrophied giant cells, which result from the redifferentiation of vascular root cells. Giant cells constitute the sole source of nutrients for the nematode and are essential for growth and reproduction. Hyperplasia of surrounding root cells leads to the formation of the gall or root-knot, an easily recognized symptom of plant infection by RKNs. Secreted effectors produced in nematode salivary glands and injected into plant cells through a specialized feeding structure called the stylet play a critical role in the formation of giant cells. Here, we describe the complex interactions between RKNs and their host plants. We highlight progress in understanding host plant responses, focusing on how RKNs manipulate key plant processes and functions, including cell cycle, defence, hormones, cellular scaffold, metabolism and transport.},
